Using mass spectrometry-based stable isotope tracing and shotgun lipidomics, we established a novel link between ketogenesis and MASLD pathophysiology. Our findings show that mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consume ketone bodies to support fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and FA elongation. Analysis of (13) C-labeled FAs in hepatocytes lacking mitochondrial D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) revealed a partial reliance on mitochondrial conversion of D-betaOHB to acetoacetate (AcAc) for cytoplasmic DNL contribution, whereas FA elongation from ketone bodies was fully dependent on cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS). Ketone bodies were essential for polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) homeostasis in hepatocytes, as loss of AACS diminished both free and esterified PUFAs. Ketogenic insufficiency depleted liver PUFAs and increased triacylglycerols, mimicking human MASLD, suggesting that ketogenesis supports PUFA homeostasis, and may mitigate MASLD-MASH progression in humans."

Despite nearly a century of use, the mechanisms underlying its clinical efficacy remain unknown. One of the proposed hypotheses for its anti-epileptic actions involves increased GABA concentration in the brain due to ketone bodies that become elevated with a ketogenic diet. In recent years, the notion that astrocytes could play a role in the evolution of abnormal cortical excitability in chronic neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, has received renewed attention. The present study examined the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, on GABA metabolism in rat primary cultured astrocytes. When beta-hydroxybutyrate was added to culture medium, GABA-transaminase (GABA-T) mRNA expression was significantly suppressed in time- and dose-dependent manners. GABA-T enzymatic activity in beta-hydroxybutyrate-treated astrocytes was also suppressed, in accordance with its gene expression. These effects were evident after 3 days of culture, which might coincide with depleted intracellular glycogen. GABA transporter, GAT-1, gene expression was strongly suppressed in cultured astrocytes after 5 days of culture with beta-hydroxybutyrate, although other type of GABA transporters did not display significant changes. These results suggest that beta-hydroxybutyrate induced by ketogenic diet may increase GABA concentration in the epileptic brain by suppressing astrocytic GABA degradation, leading to antiepileptic effects."

In recent years, unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., sedentary lifestyles) have contributed to a worldwide epidemic of atherosclerosis. Exercise is a known treatment of atherosclerosis, but the precise mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show that 12 weeks of regular exercise training on a treadmill significantly decreased lipid accumulation and foam cell formation in ApoE(-/-) mice fed with a Western diet, which plays a critical role in the process of atherosclerosis. This was associated with an increase in beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) levels in the serum. We provide evidence that BHB treatment in vivo or in vitro increases the protein levels of cholesterol transporters, including ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI, and is capable of reducing lipid accumulation. It also ameliorated autophagy in macrophages and atherosclerosis plaques, which play an important role in the step of cholesterol efflux. Altogether, an increase in serum BHB levels after regular exercise is an important mechanism of exercise inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis. This provides a novel treatment for atherosclerotic patients who are unable to undertake regular exercise for whatever reason. They will gain a benefit from receiving additional BHB."

The pathological process has not yet been clarified, although dysfunctional transport of Abeta across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) appears to be integral to disease development. At present, no effective therapeutic treatment against AD exists, and the adoption of a ketogenic diet (KD) or ketone body (KB) supplements have been investigated as potential new therapeutic approaches. Despite experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that KBs reduce the Abeta load in the AD brain, little information is available about the effect of KBs on BBB and their effect on Abeta transport. Therefore, we used a human in vitro BBB model, brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs), to investigate the effect of KBs on the BBB and on Abeta transport. Our results show that KBs do not modify BBB integrity and do not cause toxicity to BLECs. Furthermore, the presence of KBs in the culture media was combined with higher MCT1 and GLUT1 protein levels in BLECs. In addition, KBs significantly enhanced the protein levels of LRP1, P-gp, and PICALM, described to be involved in Abeta clearance. Finally, the combined use of KBs promotes Abeta efflux across the BBB. Inhibition experiments demonstrated the involvement of LRP1 and P-gp in the efflux. This work provides evidence that KBs promote Abeta clearance from the brain to blood in addition to exciting perspectives for studying the use of KBs in therapeutic approaches."

Dry to wet weight ratios were also reduced in lungs perfused with 5 mM beta OHB, but not with AcAc. beta OHB, at 5 mM, caused massive hemorrhage and interstitial and alveolar neutrophil infiltration, AcAc only produced engorgement of septal capillaries. Thus, pulmonary EC dysfunction occurs in rabbit lungs acutely perfused with beta OHB, but not with AcAc or glucose."

To determine the reason for this difference, we investigated the pathways of lipogenesis from [3-14C] AcAc, [3-14C] beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta OHB), [U-14C] glucose or [2-14C] pyruvate in minced lung tissue of 3- to 4-day-old rats. The addition of (-)hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, inhibited fatty acid synthesis from glucose, pyruvate, and beta OHB by 88%, 70% and 60%, respectively, but had no effect on that from AcAc. Benzene 1,2,3-tricarboxylate, an inhibitor of tricarboxylate translocase, inhibited fatty acid synthesis from all substrates by at least 50%. Incubation with aminooxyacetate, an inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferase, had no effect on lipid synthesis from glucose, pyruvate or AcAc, but increased lipid synthesis from beta OHB. Results indicate that for lipid synthesis in the neonatal lung, acetyl CoA from AcAc is derived predominantly from a cytoplasmic pathway involving AcAcCoA synthetase and AcAcCoA thiolase, whereas citrate is the major route of acetyl group transfer from glucose. Lipogenesis from beta OHB involves both the cytoplasmic and citrate pathways."

METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a KD for 6 weeks prior to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-established in vivo model of renal fibrosis in rodents. Seven days after UUO, serum and kidney samples were collected. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) concentrations and renal fibrosis were assessed. NRK52E cells were treated with TGFbeta1, a fibrosis-inducing cytokine, and with or without beta-OHB, a ketone body metabolized by KD, to investigate the mechanism underlying renal fibrosis. RESULTS: KD significantly enhanced serum beta-OHB levels in mice. Histological analysis revealed that KD alleviated structural destruction and fibrosis in obstructed kidneys and reduced the expression of the fibrosis protein markers alpha-SMA, Col1a1, and Col3a1. Expression of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), Cpt1a and Acox1, significantly decreased after UUO and were upregulated by KD. However, the protective effect of KD was abolished by etomoxir (a Cpt1a inhibitor). Besides, our study observed that KD significantly suppressed UUO-induced macrophage infiltration and the expression of IL-6 in the obstructive kidneys. In NRK52E cells, fibrosis-related signaling was increased by TGFbeta1 and reduced by beta-OHB. beta-OHB treatment restored the impaired expression of Cpt1a. The effect of beta-OHB was blocked by siRNA targeting free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), suggesting that beta-OHB might function through the FFAR3-dependent pathway.

Whereas, its exact regulatory roles and mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been full elucidated. In this study, SN4741 cells and C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish the PD model in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability and damage to dopaminergic neurons were measured by cell counting kit 8, Calcein-AM/PI staining, terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and hematoxylin & eosin staining. Corresponding assay kits and BODIPY 581/591 C11 probe evaluated oxidative stress and intracellular iron levels. Western blot examined the ferroptosis-related proteins. MPTP/MPP(+)-treatment reduced cell viability but triggered oxidative stress and ferroptosis in SNA4741 cells and brain tissues of mice. However, these effects were dramatically reversed by BHB and Fer-1 treatment. Mechanistically, Zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) was a target of BHB, and its depletion could reverse the anti-oxidative stress and anti-ferroptosis roles of BHB. Moreover, ZFP36 could directly bound to acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) mRNA to decay its expression, thus negatively modulating ACSL4-mediated oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Summary, BHB alleviated oxidative stress and ferroptosis of dopaminergic neurons in PD via modulating ZFP36/ACSL4 axis, which provided some new understanding for PD prevention and treatment."

Ketogenic diet (KD) exerts beneficial effects in various diseases, but whether it could serve as non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KD on neointimal hyperplasia and the potential mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery balloon-injury model was employed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce neointimal hyperplasia. Then, animals were subjected to either standard rodent chow or KD. For in-vitro experiment, impacts of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the main mediator of KD effects, on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation were determined. Balloon injury induced event intimal hyperplasia and upregulation of protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and these changes were significantly ameliorated by KD. In addition, beta-HB could markedly inhibit PDGF-BB induced VMSC migration and proliferation, as well as inhibiting expressions of PCNA and alpha-SMC. Furthermore, KD inhibited balloon-injury induced oxidative stress in carotid artery, indicated by reduced ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We also found balloon-injury induced inflammation in carotid artery was suppressed by KD, indicated by decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: KD attenuates neointimal hyperplasia through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. KD may represent a promising non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia associated diseases."
ENSG00000181092,ADIPOQ,0.61015576,weak,1,19141678,2009,Adipose tissue; Adrenal gland,Niacin stimulates adiponectin secretion through the GPR109A receptor.,"Niacin (nicotinic acid) has recently been shown to increase serum adiponectin concentrations in men with the metabolic syndrome. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which niacin regulates the intracellular trafficking and secretion of adiponectin. Since niacin appears to exert its effects on lipolysis through receptor (GPR109A)-dependent and -independent pathways, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the role of the recently identified GPR109A receptor in adiponectin secretion. Initial in vivo studies in rats demonstrated that niacin (30 mg/kg po) acutely increases serum adiponectin concentrations, whereas it decreases NEFAs. Further in vitro studies demonstrated an increase in adiponectin secretion and a decrease in lipolysis in primary adipocytes following treatment with niacin or beta-hydroxybutyrate (an endogenous ligand of the GPR109A receptor), but these effects were blocked when adipocytes were pretreated with pertussis toxin. Niacin had no effect on adiponectin secretion or lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which have limited cell surface expression of the GPR109A receptor. To further substantiate these in vitro findings, wild-type and GPR109A receptor knockout mice were administered a single dose of niacin or placebo, and serum was obtained for the determination of adiponectin and NEFA concentrations. Serum adiponectin concentrations increased and serum NEFAs decreased in the wild-type mice within 10 min following niacin administration. However, niacin administration had no effect on adiponectin and NEFA concentrations in the GPR109A receptor knockout mice. These results demonstrate that the GPR109A receptor plays an important role in the dual regulation of adiponectin secretion and lipolysis."

It was suggested previously that the adenosinergic system may be involved in the mediating effect of KD on suppressing seizure activity in different types of epilepsies, likely by means of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs). Thus, we tested in the present study whether exogenous ketone supplements (ketone ester: KE, 2.5 g/kg/day, ketone salt/KS + medium chain triglyceride/MCT: KSMCT, 2.5 g/kg/day) applied sub-chronically (for 7 days) by intragastric gavage can modulate absence epileptic activity in genetically absence epileptic Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. The number of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) significantly and similarly decreased after both KE and KSMCT treatment between 3rd and 7th days of gavage. Moreover, blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) levels were significantly increased alike after KE and KSMCT gavage, compared to control levels. The SWD number and betaHB levels returned to the baseline levels on the first day without ketone supplementation. To determine whether A(1)Rs can modify ketone supplement-evoked changes in absence epileptic activity, we applied a non-pro-epileptic dose of a specific A(1)R antagonist DPCPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) (intraperitoneal/i.p. 0.2 mg/kg) in combination with KSMCT (2.5 g/kg/day, gavage). As expected, DPCPX abolished the KSMCT-evoked decrease in SWD number. Thus, we concluded that application of exogenous ketone supplements may decrease absence epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats. Moreover, our results suggest that among others the adenosinergic system, likely via A(1)Rs, may modulate the exogenous ketone supplements-evoked anti-seizure effects.;Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental health problems worldwide, but the exact pathophysiology remains largely unknown. It has been demonstrated previously that administration of exogenous ketone supplement KSMCT (ketone salt/KS + medium chain triglyceride/MCT oil) by intragastric gavage for 7 days decreased the anxiety level in genetically absence epileptic Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. To investigate the potential role of the adenosinergic system in the pathomechanism of anxiety we tested whether the inhibition of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs) influence the anxiolytic effect of the exogenous ketone supplement. As A(1)Rs may mediate such an effect, in the present study we used a specific A(1)R antagonist, DPCPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) to test whether it modulates the anxiolytic effect of sub-chronically (7 days) applied KSMCT in the previously tested animal model by using elevated plus maze (EPM) test. We administered KSMCT (2.5 g/kg/day) alone by intragastric gavage and in combination with intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected of DPCPX in two doses (lower: 0.15 mg/kg, higher: 0.25 mg/kg). Control groups represented i.p saline and water gavage with or without i.p. DPCPX administration (2.5 g/kg/day). After treatments, the level of blood glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), as well as body weight were recorded. KSMCT alone significantly increased the time spent in the open arms and decreased the time spent in the closed arms, supporting our previous results. Injection of lower dose of DPCPX decreased, while higher dose of DPCPX abolished the effect of KSMCT administration on EPM. Blood betaHB levels were significantly increased after administration of KSMCT, while DPCPX did not change the KSMCT induced increase in blood betaHB levels. These results demonstrate that A(1)R inhibition modified (decreased) the anti-anxiety effect of KSMCT administration implying that the adenosinergic system, likely via A(1)Rs, may modulate the exogenous ketone supplement induced anxiolytic influence.;BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that administration of exogenous ketone supplement ketone salt (KS) and ketone ester (KE) increased blood ketone level and delayed the onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia in different rodent models, such as Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. The modulatory effect of adenosinergic system may have a role in the ketone supplementation-evoked effects on isoflurane-generated anesthesia. Thus, we investigated whether adenosine receptor antagonists can modulate the effect of exogenous ketone supplements on the onset of akinesia induced by isoflurane. METHODS: To investigate the effect of exogenous ketone supplements on anesthetic induction we used ketone supplement KE, KS, KEKS (1:1 mix of KE and KS), KSMCT and KEMCT (1:1 mix of KS and KE with medium chain triglyceride/MCT oil, respectively) in WAG/Rij rats. Animals were fed with standard diet (SD), which was supplemented by oral gavage of different ketone supplements (2.5 g/kg/day) for 1 week. After 7 days, isoflurane (3%) was administered for 5 min and the time until onset of isoflurane-induced anesthesia (time until immobility, light phase of anesthesia: loss of consciousness without movement) was measured. Changes in levels of blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), blood glucose and body weight of animals were also recorded. To investigate the putative effects of adenosine receptors on ketone supplements-evoked influence on isoflurane-induced anesthesia we used a specific adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (intraperitoneally/i.p. 0.2 mg/kg) and a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 (i.p. 0.5 mg/kg) alone as well as in combination with KEKS. RESULTS: Significant increases were demonstrated in both blood betaHB levels and the number of seconds required before isoflurane-induced anesthesia (immobility) after the final treatment by all exogenous ketone supplements. Moreover, this effect of exogenous ketone supplements positively correlated with blood betaHB levels. It was also demonstrated that DPCPX completely abolished the effect of KEKS on isoflurane-induced anesthesia (time until immobility), but not SCH 58261. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strengthen our previous suggestion that exogenous ketone supplements may modulate the isoflurane-induced onset of anesthesia (immobility), likely through A1Rs."

Many studies have implicated AMP and ATP as key metabolites mediating neuroendocrine responses to glucose, especially through their effects on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but other studies have suggested that glycolysis, and in particular the cytoplasmic conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to reduced NAD (NADH), may play a more important role than oxidative phosphorylation for some effects of glucose. To address these molecular mechanisms further, we have examined the regulation of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) in a clonal hypothalamic cell line, N-38. AgRP expression was induced monotonically as glucose concentrations decreased from 10 to 0.5 mm glucose and with increasing concentrations of glycolytic inhibitors. However, neither pyruvate nor 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate mimicked the effect of glucose to reduce AgRP mRNA, but on the contrary, produced the opposite effect of glucose and actually increased AgRP mRNA. Nevertheless, 3beta-hydroxybutyrate mimicked the effect of glucose to increase ATP and to decrease AMPK phosphorylation. Similarly, inhibition of AMPK by RNA interference increased, and activation of AMPK decreased, AgRP mRNA. Additional studies demonstrated that neither the hexosamine nor the pentose/carbohydrate response element-binding protein pathways mediate the effects of glucose on AgRP expression. These studies do not support that either ATP or AMPK mediate effects of glucose on AgRP in this hypothalamic cell line but support a role for glycolysis and, in particular, NADH. These studies support that cytoplasmic or nuclear NADH, uniquely produced by glucose metabolism, mediates effects of glucose on AgRP expression.;During fasting, increased sympathoadrenal activity leads to epinephrine release and multiple forms of plasticity within the adrenal medulla including an increase in the strength of the preganglionic --> chromaffin cell synapse and elevated levels of agouti-related peptide (AgRP), a peptidergic cotransmitter in chromaffin cells. Although these changes contribute to the sympathetic response, how fasting evokes this plasticity is not known. Here we report these effects involve activation of GPR109A (HCAR2). The endogenous agonist of this G protein-coupled receptor is beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body whose levels rise during fasting. In wild-type animals, 24-hour fasting increased AgRP-ir in adrenal chromaffin cells but this effect was absent in GPR109A knockout mice. GPR109A agonists increased AgRP-ir in isolated chromaffin cells through a GPR109A- and pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Incubation of adrenal slices in nicotinic acid, a GPR109A agonist, mimicked the fasting-induced increase in the strength of the preganglionic --> chromaffin cell synapse. Finally, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed the mouse adrenal medulla contains GPR109A messenger RNA. These results are consistent with the activation of a GPR109A signaling pathway located within the adrenal gland. Because fasting evokes epinephrine release, which stimulates lipolysis and the production of beta-hydroxybutyrate, our results indicate that chromaffin cells are components of an autonomic-adipose-hepatic feedback circuit. Coupling a change in adrenal physiology to a metabolite whose levels rise during fasting is presumably an efficient way to coordinate the homeostatic response to food deprivation."

The emerging diversity of the lysine acylation landscape prompted us to investigate the full proteomic impact of Kbhb. Global protein Kbhb is induced in a tissue-specific manner by a variety of interventions that evoke beta-OHB. Mass spectrometry analysis of the beta-hydroxybutyrylome in mouse liver revealed 891 sites of Kbhb within 267 proteins enriched for fatty acid, amino acid, detoxification, and one-carbon metabolic pathways. Kbhb inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), a rate-limiting enzyme of the methionine cycle, in parallel with altered metabolite levels. Our results illuminate the role of Kbhb in hepatic metabolism under ketogenic conditions and demonstrate a functional consequence of this modification on a central metabolic enzyme."

Because ketone bodies compete with other energetic substrates and reduce their utilization, they could participate in the development of insulin resistance in the heart. We have examined the effect of elevated levels of ketone bodies on insulin action in primary cultures of adult cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes were cultured with the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) for 4 or 16 h, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was evaluated. Although short-term exposure to ketone bodies was not associated with any change in insulin action, our data demonstrated that preincubation with beta-OHB for 16 h markedly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. This effect is concentration dependent and persists for at least 6 h after the removal of beta-OHB from the media. Ketone bodies also decreased the stimulatory effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and pervanadate on glucose uptake. This diminution could not be explained by a change in either GLUT-1 or GLUT-4 protein content in cardiomyocytes. Chronic exposure to beta-OHB was associated with impaired protein kinase B activation in response to insulin and pervanadate. These results indicate that prolonged exposure to ketone bodies altered insulin action in cardiomyocytes and suggest that this substrate could play a role in the development of insulin resistance in the heart.;Although the effects of ketogenic diets on energy and glucose homeostasis have been controversial, elevation of serum ketone levels by subcutaneous injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can improve glucose homeostasis. Ketones may work through the brain, therefore, we evaluated whether the intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrates would also modulate peripheral energy and glucose homeostasis, and through what mechanisms, in diabetic rats fed a high fat diet in short- and long-term studies. Short-term (3h) central injection of BHB (50 mug/h) improved serum glucose levels and peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) group among 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats, but not in non-diabetic Sham rats. In addition to short-term infusion, long-term (28 days) central infusion of BHB (12 mug/h) elevated serum BHB levels. Long-term infusion of BHB potentiated leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus to slightly decrease body weight in Px rats. Central BHB infusion had a greater effect on peripheral glucose metabolism than overall energy metabolism. Hepatic insulin signaling (tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2-->serine phosphorylation of Akt-->reduced expression of PEPCK) was potentiated and hepatic glucose production in the hyperinsulinemic state was suppressed in the diabetic rats. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved by central BHB infusion through enhanced whole body glucose disposal rates, but insulin secretion was not affected in the diabetic rats. In conclusion, mild ketosis by central infusion of ketones improves energy and glucose metabolism through the potentiation of leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats.;OBJECTIVE: Ketogenic diets (KD) have been shown to alleviate insulin resistance (IR) by exerting anti-lipogenic and insulin sensitizing effects in the liver through a variety of pathways. The present study sought to investigate whether a ketogenic diet also improves insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle cells through alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. METHODS: High-fat diet-induced IR mice were allowed to a 2-week ketogenic diet. Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were evaluated through GTT, ITT, and HOMA-IR. The C2C12 myoblasts exposed to palmitic acid were used to evaluate the insulin sensitization effects of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB). Molecular mechanisms concerning ER stress signaling activation and glucose uptake were assessed. RESULTS: The AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited, ER stress signaling associated with IRE1, PERK, and BIP was activated, and the number of Glut4 proteins translocated to membrane decreased in the muscle of HFD mice. However, all these changes were reversed after 2 weeks of feeding on a ketogenic diet. Consistently in C2C12 myoblasts, the AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, IRE1, and BIP were increased, and the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane decreased. However, beta-OHB treatment alleviated ER stress and improved the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that KD ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, which was partially mediated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. The insulin sensitization effect of beta-OHB is associated with up regulation of AKT/GSK3beta pathway and the increase in the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane."

While insulin depletion increases the blood concentration of ketone bodies, i.e., acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, their roles in bone metabolism have not been much studied until today. We investigated the effects of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate on mineralization of extracellular matrix in cultures of mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and primary mouse osteoblasts in the presence and absence of bone morphogenetic protein-2. Acetoacetate potentiated alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, ranging from physiological to pathological concentrations (0.05-5 mmol/L). In contrast, beta-hydroxybutyrate lowered it in the same experimental settings. Mineralization in cultures of these cells was also up-regulated by acetoacetate and down-regulated by beta-hydroxybutyrate. Similar results were obtained in cultures of mouse primary osteoblasts. Neither alkaline phosphatase mRNA nor its protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cells was affected by acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate, indicating that these ketone bodies control the enzyme activity of alkaline phosphatase in osteoblasts and hence their mineralization bi-directionally. Finally, either gene silencing of monocarboxylate transporter-1, a major transmembrate transporter for ketone bodies, nullified the effects of ketone bodies on alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. Collectively, we found that ketone bodies bidirectionally modulates osteoblast functions, which suggests that ketone bodies are important endogenous factors that regulate bone metabolism in both physiological and pathological situations."

Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

Evans blue (EB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as determinants of BBB permeability. Glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated in the right (injury side) cerebral cortex of animals. The gene expression levels for occludin, glucose transporter (Glut)-1, aquaporin4 (AQP4) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were performed, and Glut-1 and NF-kappaB activities were analyzed. BHB treatment decreased GSH and MDA levels in intact animals and in those exposed to TBI (P<0.05). Glut-1 protein levels decreased in sham, BHB and TBI plus BHB groups (P<0.05). NF-kappaB protein levels increased in animals treated with BHB and/or exposed to TBI (P<0.05). The expression levels of occludin and AQP4 did not significantly change among experimental groups. Glut-1 expression levels increased in BHB treated and untreated animals exposed to TBI (P<0.05). While NF-kappaB expression levels increased in animals in TBI (P<0.01), a decrease was noticed in these animals upon BHB treatment (P<0.01). In animals exposed to TBI, EB extravasation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex regardless of BHB treatment. Ultrastructurally, BHB attenuated but did not prevent the presence of HRP in brain capillary endothelial cells of animals with TBI, moreover, the drug also led to the observation of the tracer when used in intact rats (P<0.01). Altogether, these results showed that BHB not only failed to provide overall protective effects on BBB in TBI but also led to BBB disruption in healthy animals.;Waste removal is essential for maintaining homeostasis and the normal function of the central nervous system (CNS). The glymphatic system based on aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the endfeet of astrocytes is recently discovered as the excretion pathway for metabolic waste products of CNS. In the CNS, alpha-syntrophin (SNTA1) directly or indirectly anchors AQP4 in astrocyte membranes facing blood vessels. Studies have indicated that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can raise the expression of SNTA1 and thus restoring AQP4 polarity in mice models with Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective mechanism of BHB in rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). PDN rats were modeled under a high-fat and high-glucose diet with a low dose of streptozotocin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to observe the clearance of contrast to indicate the functional variability of the spinal glymphatic system. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by paw withdrawal threshold. The expressions of SNTA1 and AQP4 were tested, and the polarity reversal of AQP4 protein was measured. As demonstrated, PDN rats were manifested with deceased contrast clearance of the spinal glymphatic system, enhanced mechanical allodynia, lower expression of SNTA1, higher expression of AQP4, and reversed polarity of AQP4 protein. An opposite change in the above characteristics was observed in rats being treated with BHB. This is the first study that demonstrated the neuroprotective mechanism of BHB to attenuate PDN via restoration of the AQP4 polarity in the spinal glymphatic system and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for PDN.;BACKGROUND: Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. METHODS: The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. RESULTS: Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage."

However, the role of BHB in intestinal inflammation has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy controls were collected for evaluation of BHB level. Besides, the therapeutic effect of exogenous BHB in a murine model of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were assessed by body weight change, colon length, disease activity index, and histopathological sections. The regulatory effectors of BHB were analyzed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and microbe analysis in vivo. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of BHB was further verified in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). RESULTS: In this study, significantly reduced BHB levels were found in the colonic mucosa from IBD patients and correlated with IBD activity index. In addition, we demonstrated that the administration of exogenous BHB alleviated the severity of acute experimental colitis, which was characterized by less weight loss, disease activity index, colon shortening, and histology scores, as well as decreased crypt loss and epithelium damage. Furthermore, BHB resulted in significantly increased colonic expression of M2 macrophage-associated genes, including IL-4Ra, IL-10, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and chitinase-like protein 3, following DSS exposure, suggesting an increased M2 macrophage skewing in vivo. Moreover, an in vitro experiment revealed that the addition of BHB directly promoted STAT6 phosphorylation and M2 macrophage-specific gene expression in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Besides, we found that BHB obviously increased M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair through promoting intestinal epithelial proliferation. However, the enhancement effect of BHB on M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair and anti-inflammation was completely inhibited by the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we show that BHB promotes M2 macrophage polarization through the STAT6-dependent signaling pathway, which contributes to the resolution of intestinal inflammation and the repair of damaged intestinal tissues. Our finding suggests that exogenous BHB supplement may be a useful therapeutic approach for IBD treatment."

There is no simple treatment to alleviate ischemic brain injury, as thrombolytic therapy is applicable within a narrow time window. During the last years, the ketogenic diet (KD) and the exogenous administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have been proposed as therapeutic tools for acute neurological disorders and both can reduce ischemic brain injury. However, the mechanisms involved are not completely clear. We have previously shown that the D enantiomer of BHB stimulates the autophagic flux in cultured neurons exposed to glucose deprivation (GD) and in the brain of hypoglycemic rats. Here, we have investigated the effect of the systemic administration of D-BHB, followed by its continuous infusion after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), on the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Results show for the first time that the protective effect of BHB against MCAO injury is enantiomer selective as only D-BHB, the physiologic enantiomer of BHB, significantly reduced brain injury. D-BHB treatment prevented the cleavage of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2 and stimulated the autophagic flux in the ischemic core and the penumbra. In addition, D-BHB notably reduced the activation of the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway of the UPR and inhibited IRE1alpha phosphorylation. L-BHB showed no significant effect relative to ischemic animals. In cortical cultures under GD, D-BHB prevented LAMP2 cleavage and decreased lysosomal number. It also abated the activation of the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway, partially sustained protein synthesis, and reduced pIRE1alpha. In contrast, L-BHB showed no significant effects. Results suggest that protection elicited by D-BHB treatment post-ischemia prevents lysosomal rupture allowing functional autophagy, preventing the loss of proteostasis and UPR activation."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation.

For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells.

This study aims to determine whether administering beta-OHB at the time of reperfusion with a single dose can alleviate I/R injury and, if so, to define the mechanisms involved. We found plasma beta-OHB levels were elevated during ischemia in STEMI patients, albeit not to myocardial protection level, and decreased after revascularization. In mice, compared with normal saline, beta-OHB administrated at reperfusion reduced infarct size (by 50%) and preserved cardiac function, as well as activated autophagy and preserved mtDNA levels in the border zone. Our treatment with one dose beta-OHB reached a level achievable with fasting and strenuous physical activity. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) subjected to I/R, beta-OHB at physiologic level reduced cell death, increased autophagy, preserved mitochondrial mass, function, and membrane potential, in addition to attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. ATG7 knockdown/knockout abolished the protective effects of beta-OHB observed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, beta-OHB's cardioprotective effects were associated with inhibition of mTOR signaling. In conclusion, beta-OHB, when administered at reperfusion, reduces infarct size and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by increasing autophagic flux (potentially through mTOR inhibition). Since beta-OHB has been safely tested in heart failure patients, it may be a viable therapeutic to reduce infarct size in STEMI patients."

Parallel human (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04194450, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05155410) and rodent trials were conducted to characterize the effect of acute and short-term exogenous ketone supplementation on indices of brain health. First, we aimed to investigate the effect of acute and short-term supplementation of exogenous ketone monoester on circulating BDNF and cognition in adults with T2D. There were no effects of ketone supplementation on plasma BDNF or cognition. Second, we aimed to investigate the mechanistic effects of acute and chronic beta-OHB supplementation on cortical BDNF content and recognition memory in C57BL/6J mice with and without insulin resistance. Acutely, beta-OHB did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Similarly, chronic beta-OHB supplementation did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Collectively, our data demonstrates that ketone supplementation does not elevate BDNF content in humans or mice. Furthermore, our data does not support the involvement of BDNF in the potential cognitive benefits of beta-OHB supplementation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ketone supplementation does not alter circulating BDNF levels or cognition in humans with T2D.

These modified solutions however alter the function of apoptotic proteins through an unknown mechanism. We postulated that DL-LR induces apoptosis by restricting the phosphorylation of key apoptotic proteins. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 30, 5/group) were subjected to a three stage, volume-controlled hemorrhage and randomized to the following groups. 1) No hemorrhage (Sham), 2) Hemorrhage and no resuscitation (NR), 3) Resuscitation with 3x shed blood volume of racemic LR (DL-LR), 4) Resuscitation with 3x shed blood volume of LR containing only the L-isomer of lactate (L-LR), 5) Resuscitation with 3s shed blood volume of pyruvate Ringer's (PR), 6) Resuscitation with 3s shed blood volume of ketone Ringer's (KR).

Lung tissue was obtained 2 hours later and subjected to Western Blotting. The levels of Akt, Bad, and eNOS (total and phosphorylated) proteins were measured. Finally, the expression of gene coding for protein 14-3-3 was measured using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Resuscitation with DL-LR caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the total Bad and a decrease in phosphorylated Bad protein expression in the lung. It also caused an increase in the phosphorylated Akt levels and a decrease in gene coding for protein 14-3-3. These changes were consistent with signaling imbalances that favor apoptosis. Modified LR solutions, on the other hand, did not cause these alterations. Phosphorylation pattern of eNOS supported the involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway in this process. CONCLUSION: Racemic lactate plays a role in the induction of pulmonary apoptosis by restricting phosphorylation of Bad and eNOS proteins.;BACKGROUND: Resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's solution induces cellular apoptosis. This study was conducted to determine if the elimination of D-lactate isomer would attenuate apoptosis in the liver, and to investigate the possible mechanisms. STUDY DESIGN: Sprague Dawley rats (n=30, 5 per group) were subjected to modified volume-controlled hemorrhage and randomized to the following groups: no hemorrhage (sham), no resuscitation (NR), resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's (DL-LR), L-isomer LR (L-LR), ketone (beta-hydroxybuturate) Ringer's (KR), or pyruvate Ringer's (PR). Animals were sacrificed 2 hours later and expressions of proapoptotic proteins (BAD), antiapoptotic (bcl-2) proteins, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage in liver were analyzed by Western blotting. Contribution of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3k/Akt) pathway was assessed by measuring total and phosphorylated PI3K, Akt, BAD, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) proteins. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect the apoptotic cells. Liver ATP levels were measured using a luciferase reaction assay. RESULTS: Hemorrhage significantly decreased the hepatic ATP level and resuscitation improved it, but it returned to normal only in the L-isomer lactated Ringer's and ketone Ringer's groups. Expression of proapoptotic proteins was significantly lower in the pyruvate Ringer's and ketone Ringer's groups, L-isomer lactated Ringer's and pyruvate Ringer's resuscitation significantly increased bcl-2 expression. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase fragmentation and total number of apoptotic cells were significantly increased in the racemic lactated Ringer's group. There was no significant induction of Akt activity or changes in phosphorylated BAD, Akt, or eNOS levels. CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's induces hepatic apoptosis, which is decreased if the D-isomer of lactate is eliminated. Apoptosis is reduced even more when lactate is substituted with beta-hydroxybutyrate or pyruvate. The beneficial effects are not through improvements in the energy status or activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway."

We hypothesized that the use of energy substrates, such as ketone bodies, in the resuscitation fluids would protect against this injury. As markers of cellular injury we measured the induction of apoptotic cell death and the expression of Intracellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1). STUDY DESIGN: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 35) under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia had placement of femoral arterial and venous catheters. A three-stage hemorrhage model was used for this experiment. There was an initial hemorrhage of 27 mL/kg for 10 minutes. During the next 75 minutes another 8 mL/kg of blood was withdrawn at a steady rate. The resuscitation fluids were then infused for 45 minutes during which the third continuous hemorrhage of 8 mL/kg was performed. The animals were randomized to five groups: 1) sham hemorrhage (n = 6), 2) sham resuscitation (n = 7), 3) Lactated Ringer's resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 8), 4) Ketone Ringer's (containing 28 mEq/L of beta-hydroxybutyrate) resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 7), and 5) plasma resuscitation, volume equal to shed blood (n = 7). The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after resuscitation and lungs were harvested. Western blot technique was used for the determination of proapoptotic protein (bax), antiapoptotic protein (bcl-2), apoptotic fragments of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, and ICAM-1. Sections of lung were also subjected to immunostaining using antibodies to bax and ICAM-1 proteins (reported as number of positive cells/mm2). RESULTS: Lactated Ringer's resuscitation caused a significant increase in pulmonary apoptosis and ICAM-1 expression compared with the sham hemorrhage group. Animals resuscitated with Ketone Ringer's solution and plasma did not show this injury pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of lactate with ketone bodies in the resuscitation fluid attenuates the expression of cellular injury markers in the lung.;D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) is a predominant member of ketone bodies produced by hepatocytes and, to a lesser extent, by astrocytes. It is an alternative source of energy in the brain when glucose supply is depleted such as during starvation. It has been reported that ketone bodies could protect dopaminergic culture. However, the biological function of DbetaHB in Parkinson disease (PD) is still unclear. In the present work, we investigated the role of DbetaHB in protecting rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from apoptosis induced by 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). DbetaHB rescued PC12 cells from apoptotic death induced by 6-OHDA by MTT assay, acridine orange (AO) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and the activity of caspase-3. DbetaHB prevented the decrease of cell viability and the increase of caspase-3 activity induced by 6-OHDA in a dose-dependent manner in PC12 cells. AO and TUNEL staining showed that DbetaHB prevented the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax at mRNA levels, which regulates the apoptosis of PC12 cells when exposed to 6-OHDA, increased when DbetaHB was preincubated. The data showed that DbetaHB inhibited the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA in relation to up-regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax mRNA.;The aim was to investigate whether the combination of hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac) and ethyl beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBET) can improve the cognition of heat-stressed mice, meanwhile exploring the mechanism of action. Mice were divided into 5 groups: control, heat-stressed, HT-ac, HBET, and HT-ac + HBET. Mice were gavaged for 21 days and exposed to heat (42.5 +/- 0.5  degrees C, RH 60 +/- 10%, 1 h day(-1)) on days 15-21, except for the control group. Results showed that the combination of HT-ac + HBET improved the cognitive and learning abilities of heat-stressed mice, which were tested by Morris water maze, shuttle box, and jumping stage tests. The combination of HT-ac + HBET maintained the integrity of neurons and mitochondria of heat-stressed mice. Likewise, this combination increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, the ATP content, the expression of phosphorylated PKA, BDNF, phosphorylated CREB and Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and intracytoplasmic Cyt C in heat-stressed mice.;Cisplatin, as a commonly used anticancer drug, can easily lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), and has received more and more attention in clinical practice. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) is a metabolite in the body and acts as an inhibitor of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing inflammatory responses and apoptosis. However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway."

The data showed that DbetaHB inhibited the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA in relation to up-regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax mRNA.;Neuroprotective properties of ketosis may be related to the upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, a primary constituent associated with hypoxic angiogenesis and a regulator of neuroprotective responses. The rationale that the utilization of ketones by the brain results in elevation of intracellular succinate, a known inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase (the enzyme responsible for the degradation of HIF-1alpha) was deemed as a potential mechanism of ketosis on the upregulation of HIF-1alpha. The neuroprotective effect of diet-induced ketosis (3 weeks of feeding a ketogenic diet), as pretreatment, on infarct volume, after reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the upregulation of HIF-1alpha were investigated. The effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), as a pretreatment, via intraventricular infusion (4 days of infusion before stroke) was also investigated following MCAO. Levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) proteins and succinate content were measured. A 55% or 70% reduction in infarct volume was observed with BHB infusion or diet-induced ketosis, respectively. The levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 proteins increased threefold with diet-induced ketosis, BHB infusions also resulted in increases in these proteins. As hypothesized, succinate content increased by 55% with diet-induced ketosis and fourfold with BHB infusion. In conclusion, the biochemical link between ketosis and the stabilization of HIF-1alpha is through the elevation of succinate, and both HIF-1alpha stabilization and Bcl-2 upregulation play a role in ketone-induced neuroprotection in the brain.;BACKGROUND: To compare the protective effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA) on human lens epithelial cells(HLECs) following ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure. METHODS: HLECs were divided into subgroups: four HDACi groups, a control group, a UVB-treated group and a DMSO group (cells treated with DMSO and UVB irradiation). In the HDACi groups, HLECs were cultured with different concentrations of HDACis 12 h prior to UVB irradiation. The protective effects of the HDACis were evaluated by assessing apoptosis rates, cell activity and expression levels of genes associated with apotosis (caspase-3, Bcl-2, BAX, SOD1, FOXO3A and MT2). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were detected in order to evaluate oxidative stress. RESULTS: The results showed that SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) and TSA (0.2 mumol/L) had mild protective effects on cell viability. betaOHB (4 mmol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L) demonstrated protective effects on BCL-2 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) showed protective effects on SOD1 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) and SAHA (1 mumol/L) suppressed BAX and caspase-3 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L) and SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) suppressed the expression of FOXO3A and MT2. SOD levels were increased after treatment with betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (8 mumol/L) and TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L). T-AOC levels were increased in UVB-treated HLECs after treatment with SAHA (2 mumol/L). MDA levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L). ROS levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L). Western blotting results demonstrated that SOD1 levels significantly increased in the betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L), TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L) and VPA (5 mmol/L) groups. Only SAHA (1 mumol/L) had an anti-apoptotic effect on UVB-treated HLECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that low concentrations of HDACis (1 mumol/L of SAHA) mildly inhibit oxidative stress, thus protecting HLECs from oxidation. These results may suggest that there is a possibility to explore the clinical applications of HDACis for treatment and prevention of cataracts.;The aim was to investigate whether the combination of hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac) and ethyl beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBET) can improve the cognition of heat-stressed mice, meanwhile exploring the mechanism of action.

We have investigated the possibility that exercise training can increase the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidize ketones. In this study we measured rates of D-beta[3-14-C]-hydroxybutyrate and [3-14-C]acetoacetate oxidation, and the levels of activity of the enzymes involved in the oxidation of ketones in homogenates of gastrocnemius muscles of exercise-trained and of untrained male rats. The trained animals had markedly lower blood ketone levels immediately and 60 min after a 90 min long bout of exercise than did the sedentary animals. The rates of D-beta-[13-14C]hydroxybutryate and [3-14-C]acetoacetate oxidation were twice as high in homogenates of muscles from the trained as compared to the sedentary rats. The increases in levels of activity in gastrocnemius muscle in response to the exercise program were: beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase threefold, 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase twofold, and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 55%. This exercise-induced increase in the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidize ketones could play a role in preventing development of ketosis in the physically trained animal during and following prolonged strenuous exercise.;To investigate the mechanisms of the antiammoniagenic effect of ketone bodies, acidotic dogs (NH4Cl) were infused with either beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate. Total blood ketones ranged from 2 to 4 mM. Renal ammoniagenesis fell by a mean of 53%, with a proportional decrease in glutamine extraction. Glutamate release in the renal vein rose, renal extraction of lactate fell, and aspartate and alanine production decreased. Study of the metabolite profile of the renal cortex by the freeze-clamp technique before and after ketone infusion showed that tissue glutamine concentration was unchanged, whereas glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, and citrate rose. The intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway, such as phosphoenolypyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and glucose-6-phosphate, fell significantly. The redox state as calculated from the free NAD+/NADH ratios in the cytosolic (lactate dehydrogenase) and the mitochondrial (glutamate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) compartments was reduced. The present study suggests that ketone bodies inhibit renal ammoniagenesis through increased generation of alpha-ketoglutarate (metabolic or bicarbonate effect) and a decrease in the mitochondrial and cytosolic redox potentials in the kidney.;The precursor cells for metabolically beneficial beige adipocytes can alternatively become fibrogenic and contribute to adipose fibrosis. We found that cold exposure or beta3-adrenergic agonist treatment of mice decreased the fibrogenic profile of precursor cells and stimulated beige adipocyte differentiation. This fibrogenic-to-adipogenic transition was impaired in aged animals, correlating with reduced adipocyte expression of the transcription factor PRDM16. Genetic loss of Prdm16 mimicked the effect of aging in promoting fibrosis, whereas increasing PRDM16 in aged mice decreased fibrosis and restored beige adipose development. PRDM16-expressing adipose cells secreted the metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which blocked precursor fibrogenesis and facilitated beige adipogenesis. BHB catabolism in precursor cells, mediated by BDH1, was required for beige fat differentiation in vivo. Finally, dietary BHB supplementation in aged animals reduced adipose fibrosis and promoted beige fat formation. Together, our results demonstrate that adipocytes secrete a metabolite signal that controls beige fat remodeling.;Ketone bodies can be increased in the blood under certain physiological conditions, but their role under such conditions remains to be clarified. In the present study, we found the increment and usage of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during acute stress. BHB levels increased in the blood and PFC after 30-min acute immobilization stress, and BHB dehydrogenase 1 increased in the PFC simultaneously, but not in the hippocampus. Moreover, increased levels of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate carboxylase, and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 were found in the PFC, implicating the metabolism of increased BHB in the brain. Thus, we checked the levels of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA and found increased levels of glutamate and glutamine in the stressed group compared with that in the control group in the PFC. Exogenous administration of BHB enhanced struggling behaviors under stressful conditions. Our results suggest that the metabolism of BHB from peripheral blood in the PFC may contribute to acute stress responses to escape stressful conditions.;OBJECTIVE: Throughout the last decade, interest has intensified in intermittent fasting, ketogenic diets, and exogenous ketone therapies as prospective health-promoting, therapeutic, and performance-enhancing agents. However, the regulatory roles of ketogenesis and ketone metabolism on liver homeostasis remain unclear. Therefore, we sought to develop a better understanding of the metabolic consequences of hepatic ketone body metabolism by focusing on the redox-dependent interconversion of acetoacetate (AcAc) and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-betaOHB). METHODS: Using targeted and isotope tracing high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, dual stable isotope tracer nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolic flux modeling, and complementary physiological approaches in novel cell type-specific knockout mice, we quantified the roles of hepatocyte D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1), a mitochondrial enzyme required for NAD(+)/NADH-dependent oxidation/reduction of ketone bodies. RESULTS: Exogenously administered AcAc is reduced to D-betaOHB, which increases hepatic NAD(+)/NADH ratio and reflects hepatic BDH1 activity. Livers of hepatocyte-specific BDH1-deficient mice did not produce D-betaOHB, but owing to extrahepatic BDH1, these mice nonetheless remained capable of AcAc/D-betaOHB interconversion. Compared to littermate controls, hepatocyte-specific BDH1 deficient mice exhibited diminished liver tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and impaired gluconeogenesis, but normal hepatic energy charge overall. Glycemic recovery after acute insulin challenge was impaired in knockout mice, but they were not more susceptible to starvation-induced hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Ketone bodies influence liver homeostasis. While liver BDH1 is not required for whole body equilibration of AcAc and D-betaOHB, loss of the ability to interconvert these ketone bodies in hepatocytes results in impaired TCA cycle flux and glucose production. Therefore, through oxidation/reduction of ketone bodies, BDH1 is a significant contributor to hepatic mitochondrial redox, liver physiology, and organism-wide ketone body homeostasis.;Background Heart failure is responsible for approximately 65% of deaths in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, existing therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus have limited success on the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate elevation in D-beta-hydroxybutyrate improves cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Type 2 diabetic (db/db) and their corresponding wild-type mice were fed a control diet or a diet where carbohydrates were equicalorically replaced by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (ketone ester [KE]). After 4 weeks, echocardiography demonstrated that a KE diet improved systolic and diastolic function in db/db mice. A KE diet increased expression of mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase and restored decreased expression of mitochondrial beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, key enzymes in cardiac ketone metabolism. A KE diet significantly enhanced both basal and ADP-mediated oxygen consumption in cardiac mitochondria from both wild-type and db/db animals, however, it did not result in the increased mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Additionally, db/db mice on a KE diet had increased resistance to oxidative and redox stress, with evidence of restoration of decreased expression of thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidase 4 and less permeability transition pore activity in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy were significantly increased in cardiomyocytes from db/db mice on a KE diet. The increase in mitophagy was correlated with restoration of mitofusin 2 expression, which contributed to improved coupling between cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase translocation into mitochondria and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-mediated autophagosome formation. Conclusions Moderate elevation in circulating D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels via KE supplementation enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and oxygen consumption and increases resistance to oxidative/redox stress and mPTP opening, thus resulting in improvement of cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.;A ketogenic diet (KD) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) have been widely reported as effective therapies for metabolic diseases. beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in ketone metabolism. In this study, we examined the BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We found that BDH1 is downregulated in the kidneys in DKD mouse models, patients with diabetes, and high glucose- or palmitic acid-induced human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. BDH1 overexpression or betaOHB treatment protects HK-2 cells from glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by inhibiting reactive oxygen species overproduction. Mechanistically, BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolism activates NRF2 by enhancing the metabolic flux of betaOHB-acetoacetate-succinate-fumarate. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that adeno-associated virus 9-mediated BDH1 renal expression successfully reverses fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidneys of C57 BKS db/db mice. Either betaOHB supplementation or KD feeding could elevate the renal expression of BDH1 and reverse the progression of DKD. Our results revealed a BDH1-mediated molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of DKD and identified BDH1 as a potential therapeutic target for DKD.;Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has gained attention as a dietary regimen that promotes metabolic health. This study questioned if the health benefits of an intermittent TRF (iTRF) schedule require ketone flux specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Notably, we found that the ketolytic enzyme beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is uniquely enriched in isolated mitochondria derived from heart and red/oxidative skeletal muscles, which also have high capacity for fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Using mice with BDH1 deficiency in striated muscles, we discover that this enzyme optimizes FAO efficiency and exercise tolerance during acute fasting. Additionally, iTRF leads to robust molecular remodeling of muscle tissues, and muscle BDH1 flux does indeed play an essential role in conferring the full adaptive benefits of this regimen, including increased lean mass, mitochondrial hormesis, and metabolic rerouting of pyruvate. In sum, ketone flux enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics and supports iTRF-induced remodeling of skeletal muscle and heart.;Therapeutic interventions targeting hepatic lipid metabolism in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and steatohepatitis (MASH) remain elusive. Using mass spectrometry-based stable isotope tracing and shotgun lipidomics, we established a novel link between ketogenesis and MASLD pathophysiology. Our findings show that mouse liver and primary hepatocytes consume ketone bodies to support fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis via both de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and FA elongation. Analysis of (13) C-labeled FAs in hepatocytes lacking mitochondrial D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) revealed a partial reliance on mitochondrial conversion of D-betaOHB to acetoacetate (AcAc) for cytoplasmic DNL contribution, whereas FA elongation from ketone bodies was fully dependent on cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS). Ketone bodies were essential for polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) homeostasis in hepatocytes, as loss of AACS diminished both free and esterified PUFAs. Ketogenic insufficiency depleted liver PUFAs and increased triacylglycerols, mimicking human MASLD, suggesting that ketogenesis supports PUFA homeostasis, and may mitigate MASLD-MASH progression in humans.;PURPOSE: Ketogenic diets are proposed as a therapeutic approach for type 1 and type 2 diabetes due to their low glucose intake. However, their potential effects on the immune system need investigation. This study aims to explore how glucose concentration and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) impact T cell phenotype, metabolism, and function, with a focus on systemic inflammatory response (T2D) and autoimmunity (T1D). METHODS: T cells from healthy donors were cultured in vitro under varying glucose concentrations with or without BHB. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze changes in T cell phenotype, while proliferation was evaluated through a CFSE dilution assay. Additionally, we used a novel flow cytometry method allowing a direct assessment of T cell metabolism. RESULTS: Culturing T cells in low glucose concentrations revealed their dependency on glucose metabolism, leading to reduced proliferation rates, overexpression of exhaustion markers and increased susceptibility to Treg suppression and the influence of immune-modulating drugs such as rapamycin, FK506, and MMF. Notably, T cells cultured in low glucose concentrations increased the expression of BDH1 to utilize BHB as an alternative fuel source. Finally, the addition of BHB to the culture effectively rescued T cell impairments caused by insufficient glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: T cells display limited capacity to adapt to low glucose levels, resulting in profound functional impairment. However, T cell functions can be efficiently recovered by the presence of 2mM BHB."

Whether induction of hyperglycemia or ketonemia achieves better neuroprotection is unknown. Hyperglycemia is neuroprotective in other brain injuries during development, however, it worsens hypoglycemia-induced injury in the adult brain via poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) overactivation. METHODS: Three-week-old rats were subjected to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and treated with 10% dextrose or 50% dextrose. Neuronal injury, PARP-1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) III/TrkB/p75(NTR) expressions were determined. In the second experiment, ketonemia was induced by administering beta-hydroxybutyrate during hypoglycemia and its effect on neuronal injury was compared with those conventionally treated using 10% dextrose. RESULTS: Both 10 and 50% dextrose administration led to hyperglycemia (50% dextrose > 10% dextrose). Compared with the 10% dextrose group, neuronal injury was greater in the 50% dextrose group and was accompanied by PARP-1 overactivation. BDNF III and p75(NTR), but not TrkBFL, mRNA expressions were upregulated. Neuronal injury was less severe in the rats subjected to ketonemia, compared with those conventionally treated using 10% dextrose. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia accentuated hypoglycemia-induced neuronal injury, likely via PARP-1 overactivation. Although BDNF was upregulated, it was not neuroprotective and potentially exaggerated injury by binding to p75(NTR) receptor. Conversely, ketonemia during hypoglycemia attenuated neuronal injury.;Exercise induces beneficial responses in the brain, which is accompanied by an increase in BDNF, a trophic factor associated with cognitive improvement and the alleviation of depression and anxiety. However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain Bdnf gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on Bdnf gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur in vivo. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the Mus musculus Bdnf gene. The metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of Bdnf promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of beta-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective Bdnf promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal Bdnf expression were observed after direct ventricular application of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that beta-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF.;Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia causes neuron cell damage, resulting in impaired cognitive function. Effective interventions to antagonize hypobaric hypoxia-induced memory impairment are in urgent need. Ketogenic diet (KD) has been successfully used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and improves cognitive behaviors in epilepsy patients and other pathophysiological animal models. In the present study, we aimed to explore the potential beneficial effects of a KD on memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia and the underlying possible mechanisms. We showed that the KD recipe used was ketogenic and increased plasma levels of ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate. The results of the behavior tests showed that the KD did not affect general locomotor activity but obviously promoted spatial learning. Moreover, the KD significantly improved the spatial memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude of 6000 m, 24 h). In addition, the improving-effect of KD was mimicked by intraperitoneal injection of BHB. The western blot and immunohistochemistry results showed that KD treatment not only increased the acetylated levels of histone H3 and histone H4 compared to that of the control group but also antagonized the decrease in the acetylated histone H3 and H4 when exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, KD-hypoxia treatment also promoted PKA/CREB activation and BDNF protein expression compared to the effects of hypoxia alone. These results demonstrated that KD is a promising strategy to improve spatial memory impairment caused by hypobaric hypoxia, in which increased modification of histone acetylation plays an important role.;Nutritional ketosis may enhance cerebral energy metabolism and has received increased interest as a way to improve or preserve performance and resilience. Most studies to date have focused on metabolic or neurological disorders while anecdotal evidence suggests that ketosis may enhance performance in the absence of underlying dysfunction. Moreover, decreased availability of glucose in the brain following stressful events is associated with impaired cognition, suggesting the need for more efficient energy sources. We tested the hypotheses that ketosis induced by endogenous or exogenous ketones could: (a) augment cognitive outcomes in healthy subjects, and (b) prevent stress-induced detriments in cognitive parameters. Adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats were used to investigate metabolic and behavioral outcomes in 3 dietary conditions: ketogenic (KD), ketone supplemented (KS), or NIH-31 control diet in both control or chronic stress conditions. Acute administration of exogenous ketones resulted in reduction in blood glucose and sustained ketosis. Chronic experiments showed that in control conditions, only KD resulted in pronounced metabolic alterations and improved performance in the novel object recognition test. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response revealed that KD-fed rats maintained peripheral ketosis despite increases in glucose whereas no diet effects were observed in ACTH or CORT levels. Both KD and KS-fed rats decreased escape latencies on the third day of water maze, whereas only KD prevented stress-induced deficits on the last testing day and improved probe test performance. Stress-induced decrease in hippocampal levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate was attenuated in KD group while both KD and KS prevented stress effects on BDNF levels. Mitochondrial enzymes associated with ketogenesis were increased in both KD and KS hippocampal samples and both endothelial and neuronal glucose transporters were affected by stress but only in the control diet group. Our results highlight the complex relationship between peripheral metabolism, behavioral performance and biochemical changes in the hippocampus. Endogenous ketosis improved behavioral and metabolic parameters associated with energy metabolism and cognition while ketone supplementation replicated the biochemical effects within the hippocampus but only showed modest effects on behavioral improvements.;Neurobiological evidence suggests that the ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) exerts many neuroprotective functions for the brain. The previous study revealed that BHBA could promote the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at glucose inadequate condition. Here we demonstrated that BHBA administration induced the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of mice fed with normal diet. In vitro experiment results also showed that 0.02-2 mM BHBA significantly increased BDNF expression in both the primary hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus neuron cell line HT22 under adequate glucose supply. Bdnf transcription induced by BHBA stimulus was mediated through the cAMP/PKA-triggered phosphorylation of CREB (S133) and the subsequent up-regulation of histone H3 Lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) binding at Bdnf promoters I, II, IV, and VI. Moreover, BHBA stimulus induced a decrease in tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) binding at the Bdnf promoters II and VI and the elevation of H3K27me3-specific demethylase JMJD3, which also contributed to the activation of Bdnf transcription. These results demonstrated that BHBA within the physiological range could promote BDNF expression in neurons via a novel signaling function. Moreover, BHBA might possess more broad epigenetic regulatory activities, which affected both the acetylation and demethylation of H3K27. Our findings reinforce the beneficial effect of BHBA on the central nervous system (CNS) and suggest that BHBA administration with no need for energy restriction might also be a promising intervention to improve the neuronal activity and ameliorate the degeneration of CNS.;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is important for brain and metabolic function. Ingestion of a ketone monoester (KME) drink containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) attenuates hyperglycemia in humans and increases neuronal BDNF in rodents. Whether KME affects BDNF in humans is currently unknown. This study examined the effect of KME ingestion before an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on plasma BDNF in normal-weight adults (NW) and adults with obesity (OB). Methods: Exploratory, secondary analyses of two studies were performed. Study 1 included NW (n = 18, age = 25.3 +/- 4.3 years, BMI = 22.2 +/- 2.3 kg/m(2)) and Study 2 included OB (n = 12, age = 48.8 +/- 9.5 years, BMI = 33.7 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2)). Participants ingested 0.45 ml/kg(-1) body weight KME or Placebo 30-min prior to completing a 75 g OGTT. beta-OHB and BDNF were measured via blood samples at fasting baseline (pre-OGTT) and 120 min post-OGTT. Results: Study 1: KME significantly increased beta-OHB by 800 +/- 454% (p < 0.001). BDNF significantly decreased post-OGTT compared to pre-OGTT in Placebo (718.6 +/- 830.8 pg/ml vs. 389.3 +/- 595.8 pg/ml, p = 0.018), whereas BDNF was unchanged in KME (560.2 +/- 689.6 pg/ml vs. 469.2 +/- 791.8 pg/ml, p = 0.28). Study 2: KME significantly increased beta-OHB by 1,586 +/- 602% (p < 0.001). BDNF was significantly higher post-OGTT in the KME condition in OB (time x condition interaction, p = 0.037). There was a moderate relationship between beta-OHB and ∆ %BDNF (r = 0.616, p < 0.001). Fasting plasma BDNF was significantly lower in OB compared to NW (132.8 +/- 142.8 pg/ml vs. 639.4 +/- 756.8 pg/ml, g = 0.845, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Plasma BDNF appears differentially impacted by KME ingestion with OGTT in OB compared to NW. Raising beta-OHB via KME may be a strategy for increasing/protecting BDNF during hyperglycemia.;Neurological evidence suggests that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) has positive effects on the central nervous system. Previous studies have explored the molecular mechanisms by which BHBA affects different brain functions, but the effects of BHBA on epigenetic modifications remain elusive. Here, we showed that BHBA enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression by increasing H3K4me3 and decreasing H2AK119ub occupancy at the Bdnf promoters I, II, IV, and VI in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, BHBA treatment induced the upregulation of H3K4me3 and downregulation of H2AK119ub on the global level, both of which were dependent on the L-type calcium channel. Additionally, the BHBA-activated L-type calcium channel subsequently triggered the activation of Ca(2+)/CaMKII/CREB signaling, and promoted the binding of p-CREB and CBP to Bdnf promoters. These results indicate that BHBA regulates cellular signaling and multiple histone modifications to cooperatively modulate BDNF, suggesting a wide range of regulatory effects of BHBA in the central nervous system.;Recent studies have shown that exercise improves skeletal muscle and cognitive function by stimulating the secretion of numerous molecules. In particular, previous studies have suggested that exercise-induced beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) release might improve skeletal muscle and cognitive function, but to date these studies have been limited to cell and animal models. Therefore, we aimed to determine how an exercise-induced increase in BHB affects skeletal muscle and cognitive function at a cellular level, in an animal model, and in humans. The effects of BHB on skeletal muscle and cognitive function were determined by treating C2C12 and C6 cell lines with BHB, and by measuring the skeletal muscle and serum BHB concentrations in aged mice after endurance or resistance exercise. In addition, serum BHB concentration was measured before and after high-speed band exercise in elderly people, and its relationships with muscle and cognitive function were analyzed. We found that BHB increased cell viability and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression level in C6 cells, and endurance exercise, but not resistance exercise, increased the muscle BHB concentration in aged mice. Furthermore, the BHB concentration was positively related to skeletal muscle and cognitive function. Exercise did not increase the serum BHB concentration in the elderly people and BHB did not correlate with cognitive function, but after excluding the five people with the highest preexisting serum concentrations of BHB, the BHB concentrations of the remaining participants were increased by exercise, and the concentration showed a tendency toward a positive correlation with cognitive function. Thus, the BHB released by skeletal muscle following endurance exercise may improve muscle and cognitive function in animals and humans.;Adults with obesity are at increased risk of neurocognitive impairments, partly as a result of reduced cerebral blood flow and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Ketone supplements containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) are a purported therapeutic strategy for improving brain health in at-risk populations. We tested the hypothesis that short-term beta-OHB supplementation will elevate cerebral blood flow and BDNF, as well as improve cognition in adults with obesity. In a placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over design, 14 adults with obesity (10 females, aged 56 +/- 12 years, body mass index = 33.8 +/- 6.9 kg m(-2) ) consumed 30 mL (12 g) of beta-OHB or placebo thrice-daily for 14 days. Blood flow (Q) and cerebrovascular conductance (CVC) were measured in the common carotid (CCA), internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral (VA) arteries by duplex ultrasound. BDNF was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cognition was assessed by the digit-symbol substitution (DSST), Stroop and task-switching tests. Following 14 days of ketone supplementation, we observed significant improvements in cerebrovascular outcomes including Q(CCA) (+12%), Q(VA) (+11%), VA(CVC) (+12%) and VA shear rate (+10%). DSST performance significantly improved following ketone supplementation (+2.7 correct responses) and improved DSST performance was positively associated improvements in cerebrovascular outcomes including Q(CCA) , CCA(CVC) , Q(VA) and VA(CVC) . By contrast to one hypothesis, beta-OHB did not impact fasting serum and plasma BDNF. beta-OHB supplementation improved cognition in adults with obesity, which may be partly facilitated by improvements in cerebral blood flow. beta-OHB supplementation was well-tolerated and appears to be safe for cerebrovascular health, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits of beta-OHB in a population at risk of neurocognitive impairment. KEY POINTS: People with obesity are at increased risk of neurocognitive dysfunction, partly as a result of -induced reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Ketone supplements containing beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia, which may increase CBF and BDNF, thereby protecting against obesity-related cognitive dysfunction. We show for the first time that 14 days of thrice-daily beta-OHB supplementation improves aspects of cognition and increases cerebrovascular flow, conductance and shear rate in the extracranial arteries of adults with obesity. Our preliminary data indicate a significant positive relationship between elevated CBF and improved cognition following beta-OHB supplementation. This trial provides a foundation for the potential non-pharmacological therapeutic application of beta-OHB supplementation in patient groups at risk of hyperglycaemic cerebrovascular disease and cognitive dysfunction.;Mild endurance exercise has been shown to compensate for declined muscle quality and may positively affect the brain under conditions of energy restriction. Whether this involves brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in relation to central and peripheral tissue levels of associated factors such as beta hydroxy butyrate (BHB), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and thyroid hormone (T3) has not been studied. Thus, a subset of male Wistar rats housed at thermoneutrality that were fed or fasted was submitted to 30-min-mild treadmill exercise bouts (five in total, twice daily, 15 m/min, 0 degrees  inclination) over a period of 66 h. Prefrontal cortex and gastrocnemius muscle BHB, BCAA, and thyroid hormone were measured by LC-MS/MS analysis and were related to BDNF and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In gastrocnemius muscle, mild endurance exercise during fasting maintained the fasting-induced elevated BHB levels and BDNF-CREB activity and unlocked the downstream Akt-mTORC1 pathway associated with increased tissue BCAA. Consequently, deiodinase 3 mRNA levels decreased whereas increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 target FOXO1 was associated with increased deiodinase 2 mRNA levels, accounting for the increased T3 tissue levels. These events were related to increased expression of CREB and T3 target genes beneficial for muscle quality previously observed in this condition. In rat L6 myoblasts, BHB directly induced BDNF transcription and maturation. Mild endurance exercise during fasting did not increase prefrontal cortex BHB levels nor was BDNF activated, whereas increased leucine levels were associated with Akt-independent increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target P70S6K. The associated increased T3 levels modulated the expression of known T3-target genes involved in brain tissue maintenance. Our observation that mild endurance exercise modulates BDNF, mTOR and T3 during fasting provides molecular clues to explain the observed beneficial effects of mild endurance exercise in settings of energy restriction.;The aim was to investigate whether the combination of hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac) and ethyl beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBET) can improve the cognition of heat-stressed mice, meanwhile exploring the mechanism of action. Mice were divided into 5 groups: control, heat-stressed, HT-ac, HBET, and HT-ac + HBET. Mice were gavaged for 21 days and exposed to heat (42.5 +/- 0.5  degrees C, RH 60 +/- 10%, 1 h day(-1)) on days 15-21, except for the control group. Results showed that the combination of HT-ac + HBET improved the cognitive and learning abilities of heat-stressed mice, which were tested by Morris water maze, shuttle box, and jumping stage tests. The combination of HT-ac + HBET maintained the integrity of neurons and mitochondria of heat-stressed mice. Likewise, this combination increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, the ATP content, the expression of phosphorylated PKA, BDNF, phosphorylated CREB and Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and intracytoplasmic Cyt C in heat-stressed mice.;Ketone bodies including beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) have been proved the therapeutic potential in diverse neurological disorders. However, the role of beta-HB in the regulation of neurological injury after cardiac arrest (CA) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of beta-HB on brain mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological function after CA. A rat model of CA was established by asphyxia. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, control group, and beta-HB group. Animals received 200 mg/kg beta-HB or same volume vehicle at 10 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation by intraperitoneal injection. Neurological function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score and Y-maze. Neuronal cell loss and apoptosis were detected through hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Oxidative stress levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydoxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure of brain cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the protein expression levels of Bak, caspase 3, gasdermin D, caspase 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and phospho-Drp1 (ser616) were measured. We found that neurological function and survival rate were significantly higher in the beta-HB group compared with the control group. beta-HB also reduced neurons death and neurological oxidative stress after CA. Moreover, beta-HB reduced neurological injury from apoptosis and pyroptosis after CA. In addition, beta-HB maintained the structural integrity of brain mitochondria, prevented mitochondrial fission, and increased brain energy metabolism after CA. In conclusion, beta-HB beneficially affected the neurological function of rats after global cerebral ischemia, associated with decreased mitochondrial fission, and improved mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that beta-HB might benefit patients suffering from neurological dysfunction after CA.;Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a neurovascular disease, characterized by a deficiency of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a regulator of autophagy. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), previously reported as a protective agent in DR, has been associated with BDNF promotion. Here, we investigated whether systemic BHB affects the retinal levels of BDNF and local autophagy in diabetic mice with retinopathy, Methods: C57BL/6J mice were administered with intraperitoneal (i.p.) streptozotocin (STZ) (75 mg/kg) injection to develop diabetes. After 2 weeks, they received i.p. injections of BHB (25-50-100 mg/kg) twice a week for 10 weeks. Retinal samples were collected in order to perform immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and ELISA analysis, Results: BHB 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly improved retinal BDNF levels (p < 0.01) in diabetic mice. This improvement was negatively associated with autophagosome-lysosome formations (marked by LC3B and ATG14) and to higher levels of connexin 43 (p < 0.01), a marker of cell integrity. Moreover, BHB administration significantly reduced M1 microglial activation and autophagy (p < 0.01), Conclusions: The systemic administration of BHB in mice with DR improves the retinal levels of BDNF, with the consequent reduction of the abnormal microglial autophagy. This leads to retinal cell safety through connexin 43 restoration.;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).;People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, in later life. Exogenous ketone supplements containing the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) may be a strategy to protect the brain as beta-OHB can support cerebral metabolism and promote neuronal plasticity via expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Parallel human (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04194450, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05155410) and rodent trials were conducted to characterize the effect of acute and short-term exogenous ketone supplementation on indices of brain health. First, we aimed to investigate the effect of acute and short-term supplementation of exogenous ketone monoester on circulating BDNF and cognition in adults with T2D. There were no effects of ketone supplementation on plasma BDNF or cognition. Second, we aimed to investigate the mechanistic effects of acute and chronic beta-OHB supplementation on cortical BDNF content and recognition memory in C57BL/6J mice with and without insulin resistance. Acutely, beta-OHB did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Similarly, chronic beta-OHB supplementation did not alter recognition memory or BDNF content. Collectively, our data demonstrates that ketone supplementation does not elevate BDNF content in humans or mice. Furthermore, our data does not support the involvement of BDNF in the potential cognitive benefits of beta-OHB supplementation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ketone supplementation does not alter circulating BDNF levels or cognition in humans with T2D. Acute and chronic ketone supplementation in C57BL/6J mice did not change BDNF protein content or improve recognition memory. Ketone supplementation in C57BL/6J mice positively modulated beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, providing a potential future therapeutic strategy."

KB can substitute for glucose and support mitochondrial metabolism increasing cell survival. We have reported that the D-isomer of BHB (D-BHB) stimulates autophagic degradation during glucose deprivation in cultured neurons increasing cell viability. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation process of damaged proteins and organelles activated during nutrient deprivation to obtain building blocks and energy. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can contribute to neuronal death. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test whether D-BHB can preserve autophagic function in an in vivo model of excitotoxic damage induced by the administration of the glutamate receptor agonist, N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA), in the rat striatum. METHODS: D-BHB was administered through an intravenous injection followed by either an intraperitoneal injection (i.v+i.p) or a continuous epidural infusion (i.v+pump), or through a continuous infusion of D-BHB alone. Changes in the autophagy proteins ATG7, ATG5, BECLIN 1 (BECN1), LC3, Sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/ p62) and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2, were evaluated by immunoblot. The lesion volume was measured in cresyl violet-stained brain sections. RESULTS: Autophagy is activated early after NMDA injection but autophagic degradation is impaired due to the cleavage of LAMP2. Twenty-four h after NMDA intrastriatal injection, the autophagic flux is re-established, but LAMP2 cleavage is still observed. The administration of D-BHB through the i.v+pump protocol reduced the content of autophagic proteins and the cleavage of LAMP2, suggesting decreased autophagosome formation and lysosomal membrane preservation, improving autophagic degradation. D-BHB also reduced brain injury. The i.v+i.p administration protocol and the infusion of D-BHB alone showed no effect on autophagy activation or degradation.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

This reaction leads to changes in structure and functions of proteins in which the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the final outcome and cause many complications in diabetic patients. We herein examined the effect of fasting on the glycation process of human Carbonic anhydrase II under physiological conditions (37  degrees C and pH 7.4) employing various techniques, including Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and CD Spectroscopy. We found an increased 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate upon fasting. We studied various samples of control carbonic anhydrase (without glucose and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate), carbonic anhydrase with glucose, carbonic anhydrase treated with 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and carbonic anhydrase along with glucose and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The samples were incubated for 35 days under physiological conditions. Our results indicated that 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited the glycation process, decreased glucose binding to the protein, prevented the formation of AGEs, and modified the enzyme activity. Our findings would open new windows toward the enzymatic procedure which would have profound implication in understanding the diabetes mechanisms."

However, its usefulness is restricted due to the induction of nephrotoxicity. More recent research has indicated that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) protects against acute or chronic organ damage as an efficient healing agent. Nonetheless, the therapeutic mechanisms of beta-HB in acute kidney damage caused by chemotherapeutic drugs remain unclear. Our study developed a model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), which involved the administration of a ketogenic diet or beta-HB. We analyzed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels in serum, and used western blotting and immunohistochemical staining to assess ferroptosis and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (Camkk2)/AMPK pathway. The mitochondrial morphology and function were examined. Additionally, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments using selective Camkk2 inhibitor or activator to investigate the protective mechanism of beta-HB on cisplatin-induced AKI. Exogenous or endogenous beta-HB effectively alleviated cisplatin-induced abnormally elevated levels of BUN and Cr and renal tubular necrosis in vivo. Additionally, beta-HB reduced ferroptosis biomarkers and increased the levels of anti-ferroptosis biomarkers in the kidney. beta-HB also improved mitochondrial morphology and function. Moreover, beta-HB significantly attenuated cisplatin-induced cell ferroptosis and damage in vitro. Furthermore, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining indicated that beta-HB may prevent kidney injury by regulating the Camkk2-AMPK pathway. The use of the Camkk2 inhibitor or activator verified the involvement of Camkk2 in the renal protection by beta-HB. This study provided evidence of the protective effects of beta-HB against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and identified inhibited ferroptosis and Camkk2 as potential molecular mechanisms.;BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Sodium-glucose cotransporter protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are antihyperglycemic agents that provide additional renal-protective effects in patients with DKD, independent of their glucose-lowering effects. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study hypothesized that SGLT2i could alleviate diabetic kidney injury by inhibiting ferroptosis and explored its potential mechanisms. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into the control, DKD, DKD+dapagliflozin, and DKD+insulin treatment groups. Blood glucose levels and body weight were monitored. Renal function, tissue pathology, mitochondrial morphology and function, and lipid peroxidation biomarkers (lipid peroxidation [LPO], malondialdehyde [MDA], glutathione peroxidase 4 [GPX4], glutathione [GSH], and cystine transporter solute carrier family 7 member 11 [SLC7A11]) were evaluated. Human proximal tubule cells (HK2 cells) were exposed to high glucose alone or in combination with dapagliflozin. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, NAD+/NADH ratio (oxidized/reduced ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and lipid peroxidation were measured. In addition, the role of the beta-hydroxybutyrate- Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase 2 (BHB-CaMKK2) axis in mediating dapagliflozin regulating ferroptosis was examined. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin significantly ameliorated kidney injury in mice with DKD. Typical changes in ferroptosis, including lipid peroxidation and impaired antioxidant capacity, increased in mice with DKD and HG-treated HK-2 cells. Dapagliflozin significantly improves ferroptosis-related lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, dapagliflozin suppressed the expression of CaMKK2, a key ferroptosis regulator. Specific CaMKK2 inhibitors alleviated mitochondrial damage and ferroptosis, whereas a CaMKK2 agonist counteracted the protective effects of dapagliflozin against mitochondrial, antioxidant, and anti-ferroptosis effects. In addition, dapagliflozin increased BHB production, which mediates its nephroprotective effects. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin improves DKD by inhibiting ferroptosis, promoting BHB production, and regulating CaMKK2."
ENSG00000164047,CAMP,0.4934696,weak,1,181503,1976,,"Inhibition of adenosine 3':k'-monophosphate accumulation white fat acids, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate.","The large increase in cyclic AMP accumulation by rat white fat cells seen in the presence of lipolytic agents plus methylxanthines and adenosine deaminase was markedly inhibited by lactate. However, lipolysis was unaffected by lactate. Octanoate, hexanoate, heptanoate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited both cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis by rat fat cells. The mechanism by which these acids inhibit lipolysis differs from that for long chain fatty acids such as oleate. Oleate directly inhibited triglyceride lipase activity of homogenized rat adipose tissue. In contrast, octanoate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and lacatate had no effect on triglyceride lipase activity. Hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of rat fat cell ghosts was inhibited by oleate and 4mM octanoate but not by 1.6 mM octanoate, heptanoate, hexanoate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or lactate. None of the acids affected the soluble protein kinase activity of rat adipose tissue. There was no stimulation by lactate, butyrate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or octanoate of the soluble or particulate cyclic AMP antilipolytic action of a short chain acid such as octanoate or hexanoate was not accompanied by any drop in total fat cell ATP. The mechanism by which lactate lowers cyclic AMP but not lipolysis remains to be established."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;Ketone bodies including beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) have been shown to protect against ischemic tissue injury when present at low concentrations. We evaluated the impact of beta-OHB on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Mice were treated with a continuous infusion of beta-OHB using an osmotic mini-pump before and after IRI. We also tested the effects of increasing endogenous serum beta-OHB levels by fasting. Renal IRI was attenuated by beta-OHB treatment compared to saline control, with similar results in the fasting condition. beta-OHB treatment reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and increased expression of forkhead transcription factor O3 (FOXO3), an upstream regulator of pyroptosis. Although beta-OHB treatment did not impact markers of apoptosis, it decreased the expression of caspase-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that beta-OHB blocked pyroptosis. In a human proximal tubular cell line exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, beta-OHB reduced cell death in a FOXO3-dependent fashion. Histone acetylation was decreased in kidneys exposed to IRI and in proximal tubular cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and this effect was ameliorated by beta-OHB through the inactivation of histone deacetylases. In vitro, beta-OHB treatment restored histone acetylation at the FOXO3 promoter. Consistent with epigenetic molecular effects, the renoprotective effects of beta-OHB were still observed when the continuous infusion was stopped at the time of IRI. Thus, beta-OHB attenuates renal IRI through anti-pyroptotic effects, likely mediated by an epigenetic effect on FOXO3 expression.;SCOPE: Cell culture studies indicate that the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) directly inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation. However, direct evidence demonstrating this effect in humans is lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effects of acutely raising blood beta-OHB in healthy humans, two separate randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experiments are conducted using similar methods but each employed different exogenous ketone supplements. Participants' blood beta-OHB is directly elevated by ketone salts (0.3 g beta-OHB per kg, Study 1, N = 10 males) or ketone monoester (0.482 g beta-OHB per kg, Study 2, N = 18, equal males/females). Markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation include caspase-1, IL-1beta secretion, and IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA in LPS-stimulated whole blood collected at the baseline and 30 minutes following supplementation. Caspase-1 activation increases after ketone salt (Study 1: condition x time interaction, p = 0.012) and monoester supplementation (Study 2: condition x time interaction, p = 0.016) compared to placebo. IL-1beta secretion increases (main effect of condition, p = 0.024, Study 2) while IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA remain unchanged. CONCLUSION: Measures of NLRP3 activation increases when blood beta-OHB is elevated using ketone supplements, suggesting that increasing beta-OHB exogenously may have unintended effects that augment inflammatory activation.;Activation of the NOD-like receptor pyrin-domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in metabolic diseases such as obesity. Mechanistic studies have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) attenuates activation of NLRP3, but human data are limited. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial (n = 11) we tested the hypothesis that acutely raising beta-OHB by ingestion of exogenous ketones would attenuate NLRP3 activation in humans with obesity. Blood was sampled before and 30 min post-ingestion of a ketone monoester drink ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, 482 mg/kg body mass) or placebo. A 75 g oral glucose load was then ingested, and a third blood sample was obtained 60 min following glucose ingestion. NLRP3 activation was quantified by assessing monocyte caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1beta secretion in ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole-blood cultures. LPS-stimulated caspase-1 activation increased following glucose ingestion (main effect of time, p = 0.032), with no differences between conditions. IL-1beta secretion did not differ between conditions but was lower 60 min post-glucose ingestion compared to the fasting baseline (main effect of time, p = 0.014). Plasma IL-1beta was detectable in ~80% of samples and showed a decrease from fasting baseline to 60 min in the ketone condition only (condition x time interaction, p = 0.01). In individuals with obesity, an excursion into hyperglycemia following ingestion of a glucose load augments LPS-induced activation of caspase-1 in monocytes with no apparent impact of raising circulating beta-OHB concentration via ingestion of exogenous ketones. Exogenous ketone supplementation may impact plasma IL-1beta, but these findings require confirmation in studies with larger sample sizes.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.;Chronic, low-grade inflammation is associated with the development of numerous diseases and is mediated in part by overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome and alters intracellular signalling pathways in vitro and in animal models, however, this effect has not yet been shown in vivo in humans. The purpose of this single-arm pilot trial was to determine if consuming 15 mL of C(8) medium-chain triglyceride (trioctanoin, MCT) oil, which induces mild elevation of betaHB, twice daily (30 mL total) for 14 days would suppress markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in young, healthy humans while following their habitual diet. Consuming a single dose of 15 mL of C(8) MCT oil significantly raised blood betaHB from fasting at 60 minutes and 120 minutes post ingestion (both P < 0.05). However, consumption of C(8) MCT oil for 14 days did not impact markers of monocyte NLRP3 inflammasome activation compared to baseline. Specifically, caspase-1 activation and secretion of its downstream product interleukin (IL)-1beta were unchanged following 14 days of C(8) MCT oil supplementation when measured in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures (all P > 0.05). Acetylation of histone H3 on the lysine residue 9 was unchanged (P < 0.05) and acetylation of lysine residue 14 was decreased (P < 0.05) following 14 days of supplementation. Thus, adding twice daily C(8) MCT oil supplementation to the habitual diet of young, healthy humans does not appear to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation.;Ketone bodies including beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) have been proved the therapeutic potential in diverse neurological disorders. However, the role of beta-HB in the regulation of neurological injury after cardiac arrest (CA) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of beta-HB on brain mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological function after CA. A rat model of CA was established by asphyxia. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, control group, and beta-HB group. Animals received 200 mg/kg beta-HB or same volume vehicle at 10 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation by intraperitoneal injection. Neurological function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score and Y-maze. Neuronal cell loss and apoptosis were detected through hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Oxidative stress levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydoxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure of brain cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the protein expression levels of Bak, caspase 3, gasdermin D, caspase 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and phospho-Drp1 (ser616) were measured. We found that neurological function and survival rate were significantly higher in the beta-HB group compared with the control group. beta-HB also reduced neurons death and neurological oxidative stress after CA. Moreover, beta-HB reduced neurological injury from apoptosis and pyroptosis after CA. In addition, beta-HB maintained the structural integrity of brain mitochondria, prevented mitochondrial fission, and increased brain energy metabolism after CA. In conclusion, beta-HB beneficially affected the neurological function of rats after global cerebral ischemia, associated with decreased mitochondrial fission, and improved mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that beta-HB might benefit patients suffering from neurological dysfunction after CA.;The current report describes a stepwise mechanistic pathway of NLRP3/caspase1/IL-18-regulated immune responses operational in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We show that esophageal epithelial cells and macrophage-derived NLRP3 regulated IL-18 initiate the disease and induced IL-5 facilitates eosinophil growth and survival. We also found that A. fumigatus-exposed IL-18(-/-) mice or IL-18-neutralized mice are protected from EoE induction. Most importantly, we present that intravascular rIL-18 delivery to DeltadblGATA mice and CD2-IL-5 mice show the development of EoE characteristics feature like degranulated and intraepithelial eosinophils, basal cell hyperplasia, remodeling and fibrosis. Similarly, we show an induced NLRP3-caspase1-regulated IL-18 pathway is also operational in human EoE. Lastly, we present the evidence that inhibitors of NLRP3 and caspase-1 (MCC950, BHB, and VX-765) protect A. fumigatus- and corn-extract-induced EoE pathogenesis. In conclusion, the current study provides a new understanding by implicating NLRP3/caspase1-regulated IL-18 pathway in EoE pathogenesis. The study has the clinical significance and novel therapeutic strategy, which depletes only IL-18-responsive pathogenic eosinophils, not naive IL-5-generated eosinophils critical for maintaining innate immunity.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;BACKGROUND: Ketone bodies are pleotropic metabolites that play important roles in multiple biological processes ranging from bioenergetics to inflammation regulation via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and epigenetic modifications. Ketone bodies are elevated in left ventricular failure (LVF) and multiple approaches that increase ketone concentrations exert advantageous cardiac effects in rodents and humans. However, the relationships between ketone bodies and right ventricular failure (RVF) are relatively unexplored. METHODS: 51 PAH patients were dichotomized into preserved or impaired RV function based on a cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m(2). Impaired RV function patients were further segmented into intermediate or severe RV dysfunction based on a right atrial pressure of 8 mm Hg. Serum ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) were quantified using ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In rodent studies, male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to three groups: control (saline injection), monocrotaline (MCT) standard chow diet (MCT-Standard), and MCT ketogenic diet (MCT-Keto). Immunoblots and confocal microscopy probed macrophage NLRP3 activation in RV extracts and sections. RV fibrosis was determined by Picrosirus Red. Echocardiography evaluated RV function. Pulmonary arteriole remodeling was assessed from histological specimens. RESULTS: Human RVF patients lacked a compensatory ketosis as serum AcAc and betaOHB levels were not associated with hemodynamic, echocardiographic, or biochemical measures of RV dysfunction. In rodent studies, AcAc and betaOHB levels were also not elevated in MCT-mediated RVF, but the ketogenic diet significantly increased AcAc and betaOHB levels. MCT-Keto exhibited suppressed NLRP3 activation with a reduction in NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein), pro-caspase-1, and interleukin-1 beta on immunoblots. Moreover, the number of ASC-positive macrophage in RV sections was reduced, RV fibrosis was blunted, and RV function was augmented in MCT-Keto rats. CONCLUSION: The ketogenic response is blunted in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with RVF. In the MCT rat model of PAH-mediated RVF, a dietary-induced ketosis improves RV function, suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and combats RV fibrosis. The summation of these data suggest ketogenic therapies may be particularly efficacious in RVF, and therefore future studies evaluating ketogenic interventions in human RVF are warranted.;Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for the majority of cases, is sturdily influenced by lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, obesity, and diabetes, leading to its classification as Type 3 diabetes. To model this pathological link, our AD-like model was developed by feeding Wistar male rats a high-fat diet with fructose in drinking water (HFFD) for 8 weeks, followed by a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This group was compared with a normal control group fed a standard diet and a beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-treated group (125 mg/kg, p.o.), administered starting 3 h after LPS and continuing for 1 week. The results demonstrate that BHB treatment illuminated cognitive gains, as indicated by the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1beta/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function."

Addition of 4 mM Na D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, protected the cells for 2 hr and maintained the increase in survival compared to that of controls for up to 6 hr. Trypan blue exclusion indicated that acute cell death was reduced markedly after 2-hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group. The presence of bHB also decreased the number of neurons exhibiting condensed nuclei visualized by propidium iodide, indicative of apoptosis. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Em/c) was maintained for up to 2 hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group, whereas the potential in the control group was decreased. Furthermore, cytochrome C release, caspase-3 activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage were decreased in the bHB-treated group for the first 2 hr of exposure. These findings indicate that ketone bodies may be a candidate for widening the therapeutic window before thrombolytic therapy and at the same time decreasing apoptotic damage in the ischemic penumbra.;It has been postulated that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, provides models of PD both in vivo and in vitro. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, against rotenone toxicity by using SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y cells, differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid, were exposed to rotenone at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1,000 nM. We evaluated cellular oxidation reduction by the alamarBlue assay, viability by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and survival/death ratio by live/dead assays. Exposure to rotenone for 48 hr oxidized cells and decreased their viability and survival rate in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with 8 mM bHB provided significant protection to SH-SY5Y cells. Whereas rotenone caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c into the cytosol, and reduced cytochrome c content in mitochondria, addition of bHB blocked this toxic effect. bHB also attenuated the rotenone-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Administration of 0-10 mM 3-nitropropionic acid, a complex II inhibitor, also decreased the reducing power of SH-SY5Y cells measured by alamarBlue assay. Pretreatment with 8 mM bHB attenuated the decrease of alamarBlue fluorescence. These data demonstrated that bHB had a neuroprotective effect that supported the mitochondrial respiration system by reversing the inhibition of complex I or II. Ketone bodies, the alternative energy source in the mammalian brain, appear to have therapeutic potential in PD.;D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB) is a predominant member of ketone bodies produced by hepatocytes and, to a lesser extent, by astrocytes. It is an alternative source of energy in the brain when glucose supply is depleted such as during starvation. It has been reported that ketone bodies could protect dopaminergic culture. However, the biological function of DbetaHB in Parkinson disease (PD) is still unclear. In the present work, we investigated the role of DbetaHB in protecting rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from apoptosis induced by 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). DbetaHB rescued PC12 cells from apoptotic death induced by 6-OHDA by MTT assay, acridine orange (AO) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and the activity of caspase-3. DbetaHB prevented the decrease of cell viability and the increase of caspase-3 activity induced by 6-OHDA in a dose-dependent manner in PC12 cells. AO and TUNEL staining showed that DbetaHB prevented the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax at mRNA levels, which regulates the apoptosis of PC12 cells when exposed to 6-OHDA, increased when DbetaHB was preincubated. The data showed that DbetaHB inhibited the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA in relation to up-regulating the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax mRNA.;Mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, is associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Rotenone, a mitochondrial stressor induces caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation leading proteolytic cleavage of substrate nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP cleavage is directly related to apoptotic cell death. In this study, we have monitored the aggregation of green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged synphilin-1, as a rotenone-induced Parkinsonia-onset biomarker. We report that the innate ketone body, Na-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (NabetaHB) reduces markedly the incidence of synphilin-1 aggregation. Furthermore, our data reveal that the metabolic byproduct also prevents rotenone-induced caspase-activated apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these results suggest that NabetaHB is neuroprotective, it attenuates effects originating from mitochondrial insult and can serve as a scaffold for the design and development of sporadic neuropathies.;Oxidative stress has an important role in neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemic injury. It is reported that d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DbetaHB), the major component of ketone bodies, is neuroprotective in recent studies. Therefore, in the present work the neuroprotective effects of DbetaHB on H2O2-induced apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress was investigated. PC12 cells were exposed to H2O2 with different concentrations of H2O2 for different times after DbetaHB pretreatment. MTT assay, apoptotic rates, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, GSH content, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase-3 activity were determined. The results showed that DbetaHB inhibited the decrease of cell viability induced by H2O2 in PC12 cells. DbetaHB decreased the apoptotic rates induced by H2O2. The changes of intracellular ROS, GSH, MMP and caspase-3 activity due to H2O2 exposure were partially reversed in PC12 cells. So DbetaHB inhibited the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by H2O2 via inhibiting oxidative stress.;The aim was to investigate whether the combination of hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac) and ethyl beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBET) can improve the cognition of heat-stressed mice, meanwhile exploring the mechanism of action. Mice were divided into 5 groups: control, heat-stressed, HT-ac, HBET, and HT-ac + HBET. Mice were gavaged for 21 days and exposed to heat (42.5 +/- 0.5  degrees C, RH 60 +/- 10%, 1 h day(-1)) on days 15-21, except for the control group. Results showed that the combination of HT-ac + HBET improved the cognitive and learning abilities of heat-stressed mice, which were tested by Morris water maze, shuttle box, and jumping stage tests. The combination of HT-ac + HBET maintained the integrity of neurons and mitochondria of heat-stressed mice. Likewise, this combination increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, the ATP content, the expression of phosphorylated PKA, BDNF, phosphorylated CREB and Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and intracytoplasmic Cyt C in heat-stressed mice.;Ketone bodies including beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) have been proved the therapeutic potential in diverse neurological disorders. However, the role of beta-HB in the regulation of neurological injury after cardiac arrest (CA) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of beta-HB on brain mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological function after CA. A rat model of CA was established by asphyxia. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, control group, and beta-HB group. Animals received 200 mg/kg beta-HB or same volume vehicle at 10 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation by intraperitoneal injection. Neurological function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score and Y-maze. Neuronal cell loss and apoptosis were detected through hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Oxidative stress levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydoxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure of brain cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the protein expression levels of Bak, caspase 3, gasdermin D, caspase 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and phospho-Drp1 (ser616) were measured. We found that neurological function and survival rate were significantly higher in the beta-HB group compared with the control group. beta-HB also reduced neurons death and neurological oxidative stress after CA. Moreover, beta-HB reduced neurological injury from apoptosis and pyroptosis after CA. In addition, beta-HB maintained the structural integrity of brain mitochondria, prevented mitochondrial fission, and increased brain energy metabolism after CA. In conclusion, beta-HB beneficially affected the neurological function of rats after global cerebral ischemia, associated with decreased mitochondrial fission, and improved mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that beta-HB might benefit patients suffering from neurological dysfunction after CA.;Cisplatin, as a commonly used anticancer drug, can easily lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), and has received more and more attention in clinical practice. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) is a metabolite in the body and acts as an inhibitor of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing inflammatory responses and apoptosis. However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;beta-Hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the primary circulating ketone body, plays a dual role as both a metabolic fuel and an endogenous signaling molecule, offering diverse systemic benefits. Recent studies have highlighted the renoprotective effects of exogenous beta-HB therapy in various animal models of kidney disease. In this investigation, our goal was to assess whether pre-treatment with exogenous beta-HB could alleviate kidney damage in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Prior to cisplatin administration, intraperitoneal administration of beta-HB was carried out, and the groups were classified into four: Sham, beta-HB, cisplatin, and beta-HB + cisplatin. The tubular damage score and serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the beta-HB + cisplatin group compared to the cisplatin group. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated NF-kappaB, inflammatory cytokines, and the quantity of F4/80-positive macrophages in the beta-HB + cisplatin group were reduced compared to those in the cisplatin group. Additionally, oxidative stress markers for DNA, protein, and lipid in the beta-HB + cisplatin group were markedly diminished compared to those in the cisplatin group. The number of TUNEL-positive and cleaved caspase 3-positive tubular cells in the beta-HB + cisplatin group was lower than in the cisplatin group. Pre-treating with exogenous beta-HB effectively mitigated kidney damage by suppressing inflammation, oxidative stress, and tubular apoptosis in cisplatin-induced AKI. Therefore, exogenous beta-HB as a pre-treatment emerges as a promising and novel strategy for preventing cisplatin-induced AKI."
ENSG00000132906,CASP9,0.42044705,weak,1,16917840,2006,Brain/CNS,D-beta-hydroxybutyrate protects dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells in a rotenone model of Parkinson's disease.,"It has been postulated that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, provides models of PD both in vivo and in vitro. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, against rotenone toxicity by using SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y cells, differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid, were exposed to rotenone at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1,000 nM. We evaluated cellular oxidation reduction by the alamarBlue assay, viability by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and survival/death ratio by live/dead assays. Exposure to rotenone for 48 hr oxidized cells and decreased their viability and survival rate in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with 8 mM bHB provided significant protection to SH-SY5Y cells. Whereas rotenone caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c into the cytosol, and reduced cytochrome c content in mitochondria, addition of bHB blocked this toxic effect. bHB also attenuated the rotenone-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Administration of 0-10 mM 3-nitropropionic acid, a complex II inhibitor, also decreased the reducing power of SH-SY5Y cells measured by alamarBlue assay. Pretreatment with 8 mM bHB attenuated the decrease of alamarBlue fluorescence. These data demonstrated that bHB had a neuroprotective effect that supported the mitochondrial respiration system by reversing the inhibition of complex I or II. Ketone bodies, the alternative energy source in the mammalian brain, appear to have therapeutic potential in PD."

In the present study we investigated the role of AcAc and BHB at concentrations found in diabetic patients during ketoacidotic crises and in individuals affected by succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiencies, disorders clinically characterized by neurological symptoms, on a large number of oxidative stress parameters in fresh cerebral cortex of developing rats. Lipid peroxidation (chemiluminescence and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels), protein oxidative damage (carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl oxidation), 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate oxidation and the non-enzymatic (total antioxidant reactivity and glutathione levels) and enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) antioxidant defenses were not changed by doses of BHB and AcAc as high as 25 mM in cortical supernatants under basal conditions. Furthermore, BHB did not affect the increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels provoked by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acids and by a hydroxyl-induced generation system. Finally, BHB and AcAc were not able to oxidize sulfhydryl groups from a commercial GSH solution. Therefore, under basal conditions or under situations with high production of free radicals, AcAc and BHB were not able to reduce or increase the oxidative stress parameters in the brain. Taken together, our present results do not support the hypothesis that BHB and AcAc act as potent direct or indirect pro-oxidants or antioxidants in the CNS.;Recent studies have shown that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) acts not only as a carrier of energy but also as a signaling molecule that has a role in diverse cellular functions. Circulating levels of ketone bodies have been previously reported to be increased in patients with congestive heart failure (HF). In this study, we investigated regulatory mechanism and pathophysiological role of betaOHB in HF. First, we revealed that betaOHB level was elevated in failing hearts, but not in blood, using pressure-overloaded mice. We also measured cellular betaOHB levels in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes stimulated with or without H2O2 and revealed that increased myocardial betaOHB was derived from cardiomyocytes but not non-cardiomyocytes under pathological states. Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms of myocardial betaOHB elevation and its implication under pathological states. The gene and protein expression levels of CoA transferase (SCOT), a key enzyme involved in ketone body oxidation, was decreased in failing hearts. In cardiomyocytes, H2O2 stimulation caused betaOHB accumulation concomitantly with SCOT downregulation, implying that the accumulation of myocardial betaOHB occurs because of the decline in its utilization. Finally, we checked the effects of betaOHB on cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress. We found that betaOHB induced FOXO3a, an oxidative stress resistance gene, and its target enzyme, SOD2 and catalase. Consequently, betaOHB attenuated reactive oxygen species production and alleviated apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. It has been reported that hyperadrenergic state in HF boost lipolysis and result in elevation of circulating free fatty acids, which can lead hepatic ketogenesis for energy metabolism alteration. The present findings suggest that the accumulation of betaOHB also occurs as a compensatory response against oxidative stress in failing hearts.;beta-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body that is used as an energy source in organs such as the brain, muscle, and heart when blood glucose is low, is produced by fatty acid oxidation in the liver under the fasting state. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe motor and sensory dysfunction and significantly reduces the quality of life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of administration of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in spinal cord-injured mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given a moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury at the T(9-10) level and treated with exogenous DBHB. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of SCI mice with DBHB markedly improved locomotor function and relieved SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation. DBHB treatment partly prevented the SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and suppressed microglial and glial activation. DBHB treatment enhanced histone acetylation and up-regulated expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, catalase and SOD2 in injured region of SCI mice. DBHB treatment suppressed SCI-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced protein expression of IL-1beta and IL-18. In addition, DBHB treatment improved mitochondrial function and abated oxidative stress following SCI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DBHB promoted functional recovery and relieved pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through inhibition of histone deacetylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preservation of mitochondrial function. DBHB could thus be envisaged as a potential use of interventions for SCI but remains to be tested in humans.;The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), is reported to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate effects of betaOHB on suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in in vivo and in vitro models. Rats were fed with ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) for 3 weeks. A C5 hemi-contusion injury was applied to these animals on the 14th day of experiment, and spinal cord samples were harvested on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after SCI, respectively. The blood ketone levels were significantly higher in the KD groups. KD reduced oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products, downregulated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and upregulated the expression of forkhead box group O (FOXO)3a, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and catalase after SCI. The in vitro study, performed on PC12 cells, indicated that betaOHB inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production, decreased NOX2 and NOX4 protein levels, and upregulated FOXO3a, MnSOD, and catalase levels in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the in vivo results. The ketone metabolite betaOHB inhibited HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 activity, but not HDAC8 in SCI rats and PC12 cells. Depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production and protein carbonylation and elevated FOXO3a protein levels, meanwhile reducing NOX2 and NOX4 protein expression in PC12 cells. Our results indicate that the ketone metabolite betaOHB attenuates oxidative stress in SCI by inhibition of class I HDACs, and selected suppression of HDAC1 or HDAC2 regulates FOXO3a, NOX2, and NOX4 expression. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.;Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) have been proposed to mediate systemic metabolic response to fasting. However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart."

METHODS: A total of 87 individuals with obesity (BMI: 36.5 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2) , age: 42.4 +/- 9.7 years, 39 males) underwent 8 weeks of a very low-energy diet. Body weight/composition, plasma concentration of betaHB, and appetite-related hormones (active ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1], total peptide YY, cholecystokinin [CCK], and insulin) and subjective appetite feelings were measured at baseline and week 9. RESULTS: Participants lost 17.7 +/- 4.1 kg and were ketotic (betaHB: 1.24 +/- 0.82 mmol/L in fasting) at week 9. A negative association was found between betaHB in fasting at week 9 and changes in basal (r = -0.315, P = 0.003) and postprandial ghrelin concentration (r = -0.286, P = 0.008), and a positive association was found with the change in postprandial GLP-1 (r = 0.244, P = 0.025) and CCK (r = 0.228, P = 0.035). No association was seen between betaHB in fasting and changes in peptide YY or subjective feelings of appetite. CONCLUSIONS: betaHB plasma concentration in fasting is associated with lower concentrations of the hunger hormone ghrelin and increased concentrations of the satiety hormones GLP-1 and CCK. Future studies should explore the molecular mechanisms by which betaHB modulates the secretion of gut hormones."

Type 1 and some type 2 diabetic patients have elevated levels of the ketone bodies acetoacetate (AA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how hyperketonemia in diabetic mothers affects markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in their offspring. METHODS: Blood was obtained from 23 diabetic mothers and 13 healthy mothers and their infants' umbilical cords at delivery. Interleukin-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and protein carbonyl (protein oxidation) levels were determined by ELISA. U937 human monocyte cell culture was used to examine the effect of AA and BHB on secretion of MCP-1. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the levels of AA in cord blood of IDMs compared with cord blood of infants of healthy mothers. A significant increase in the levels of protein oxidation (p < 0.05) and MCP-1 levels (p < 0.05) was observed in the cord blood of IDMs. The level of MCP-1 correlated significantly (r = 0.51, p = 0.01) with the concentration of AA in the IDMs. In further experiments with cultured monocytes treated with exogenous AA (0-4 mM), a significant increase in MCP-1 secretion was observed in AA- but not BHB-treated monocytes. CONCLUSION: Blood levels of AA and MCP-1 are elevated in IDMs, which may contribute to the development of the metabolic complications seen in IDMs.;Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a ketone monoester supplement on indices of muscle damage during recovery after eccentric exercise. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, independent group design, 20 moderately active healthy young adults consumed 360 mg per kg(-1) bodyweight of a ketone monoester (KET) or energy-matched carbohydrate (CON) supplement twice daily following eccentric exercise (drop jumps). Maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) torque, counter-movement jump (CMJ) height, and muscle soreness were measured before (PRE), and immediately (POST), 24 h and 48 h post-exercise. Blood samples were collected for analysis of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), creatine kinase (CK), and select pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Results: Peak blood beta-OHB concentration after supplement intake was greater (P < 0.001) in KET (4.4 +/- 0.8 mM) vs. CON (0.4 +/- 0.3 mM). Exercise increased CK concentration at 24 h and 48 h vs. PRE (time: P < 0.001) with no difference between KET and CON. Exercise reduced MIVC (KET: -19.9 +/- 14.6, CON: -22.6 +/- 11.1%) and CMJ (KET: -11.0 +/- 7.5, CON: -13.0 +/- 8.7%) at POST relative PRE, however, there was no difference between KET and CON on the recovery of MIVC at 24 h (KET: -15.4 +/- 20.4, CON: -18.7 +/- 20.1%) or 48 h (KET: -7.2 +/- 21.2, CON: -11.8 +/- 20.2%), or CMJ at 24 h (KET: -9.2 +/- 11.5, CON: -13.4 +/- 10.8) or 48 h (KET: -12.5 +/- 12.4, CON: -9.1 +/- 11.7). Muscle soreness was increased during post-exercise recovery (time: P < 0.001) with no differences between KET and CON. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was greater (group: P = 0.007) in CON (236 +/- 11 pg/mL) vs. KET (187 +/- 11 pg/mL). Conclusion: In conclusion, twice daily ingestion of a ketone monoester supplement that acutely elevates blood beta-OHB concentration does not enhance the recovery of muscle performance or reduce muscle soreness following eccentric exercise in moderately active, healthy young adults.;Ketogenic diets (KDs) are very high-fat low-carbohydrate diets that promote nutritional ketosis and are widely used for weight loss, although concerns about potential adverse cardiovascular effects remain. We investigated a very high-fat KD's vascular impact and plasma metabolic signature compared to a non-ketogenic high-fat diet (HFD). Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE (-/-)) mice were fed a KD (%kcal:81:1:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein), a non-ketogenic high-fat diet with half of the fat content (HFD) (%kcal:40:42:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein) for 12 weeks. Plasma samples were used to quantify the major ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and TNF alpha), and to targeted metabolomic profiling by mass spectrometry. In addition, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were quantified ex-vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 14-tesla system. KD was atherogenic when compared to the control diet, but KD mice, when compared to the HFD group (1) had markedly higher levels of BHB and lower levels of cytokines, confirming the presence of ketosis that alleviated the well-established fat-induced systemic inflammation, (2) displayed significant changes in the plasma metabolome that included a decrease in lipophilic metabolites and an increase in hydrophilic metabolites, (3) had significantly lower levels of several atherogenic lipid metabolites, including phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides, and (4) presented significantly lower aortic plaque burden. KD was atherogenic and was associated with specific metabolic changes but alleviated the fat-induced inflammation and lessened the progression of atherosclerosis when compared to the HFD.;Pre-clinical and cell culture evidence supports the role of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an immunomodulatory molecule that may inhibit inflammatory signalling involved in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies in humans are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time.;High glucose leads to cellular damage and dysfunction in the retina. Dietary interventions, including the use of ketogenic diets, have been explored for their potential to reduce the adverse effects of hyperglycemia. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body, has immune and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to investigate whether BHB ameliorates the harmful effects induced by high glucose in ARPE-19 cells, a model of retinal pigment epithelium. We investigated the effects induced by high glucose and/or BHB on viability, migration, colony-forming ability, cell cycle progression and cytokine production. Our data indicate that high glucose significantly reduces the viability of ARPE-19 cells with no significant changes in apoptosis or autophagy, while inducing cell cytostasis. On the other hand, BHB exerts a protective effect on ARPE-19 cells under hyperglycemic conditions improving cell viability and alleviating glucose-induced cell cycle arrest. Additionally, BHB treatment affects the expression of IL-8 and IL-17alpha, as well as of MCP-1, modulating the inflammatory response, cell migration and wound healing. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential protective role of BHB against the detrimental effects induced by high glucose on ARPE-19 cells. These findings support the use of ketone bodies in mitigating high glucose-induced cellular damage. Future research will be critical to translate these findings to the clinical practice for metabolic diseases."

We investigated a very high-fat KD's vascular impact and plasma metabolic signature compared to a non-ketogenic high-fat diet (HFD). Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE (-/-)) mice were fed a KD (%kcal:81:1:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein), a non-ketogenic high-fat diet with half of the fat content (HFD) (%kcal:40:42:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein) for 12 weeks. Plasma samples were used to quantify the major ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and TNF alpha), and to targeted metabolomic profiling by mass spectrometry. In addition, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were quantified ex-vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 14-tesla system. KD was atherogenic when compared to the control diet, but KD mice, when compared to the HFD group (1) had markedly higher levels of BHB and lower levels of cytokines, confirming the presence of ketosis that alleviated the well-established fat-induced systemic inflammation, (2) displayed significant changes in the plasma metabolome that included a decrease in lipophilic metabolites and an increase in hydrophilic metabolites, (3) had significantly lower levels of several atherogenic lipid metabolites, including phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides, and (4) presented significantly lower aortic plaque burden. KD was atherogenic and was associated with specific metabolic changes but alleviated the fat-induced inflammation and lessened the progression of atherosclerosis when compared to the HFD."

Under physiological conditions, it mainly uses lipids and glucose as energy substrates. In uncontrolled diabetes, the heart switches towards predominant lipid utilization, which over time is detrimental to cardiac function. Additionally, diabetes is accompanied by high plasma ketone levels and increased utilization of energy provision. The administration of exogenous ketones is currently being investigated for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Yet, it remains unclear whether increased cardiac ketone utilization is beneficial or detrimental to cardiac functioning. The mechanism of lipid-induced cardiac dysfunction includes disassembly of the endosomal proton pump (named vacuolar-type H+-ATPase, v-ATPase) as the main early onset event, followed by endosomal de-acidification/dysfunction. The de-acidified endosomes can no longer serve as a storage compartment for lipid transporter CD36, which then translocates to the sarcolemma to induce lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and contractile dysfunction. Lipid-induced v-ATPase disassembly is counteracted by the supply of specific amino acids. Here, we tested the effect of ketone bodies on v-ATPase assembly status and regulation of lipid uptake in rodent/human cardiomyocytes. 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) exposure induced v-ATPase disassembly and the entire cascade of events leading to contractile dysfunction and insulin resistance, similar to conditions of lipid oversupply. Acetoacetate addition did not induce v-ATPase dysfunction. The negative effects of 3HB could be prevented by addition of specific amino acids. Hence, in sedentary/prediabetic subjects ketone bodies should be used with caution because of possible aggravation of cardiac insulin resistance and further loss of cardiac function. When these latter maladaptive conditions would occur, specific amino acids could potentially be a treatment option."

Apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) is strongly associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of beta-OHB in the brain and the aorta of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-deficient mice. We found in Apo-E deficient mice that beta-OHB attenuated lipid deposition in the choroid plexus (ChP) and decreased amyloid plaque in the substantia nigra pars compacta. We also found decreased CD68-positive macroglia infiltration of the ChP in beta-OHB-treated ApoE-deficient mice. beta-OHB treatment ameliorated IgG extravasation into the hippocampal region of the brain. In vitro study using ChP mice cell line revealed that beta-OHB attenuated oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced ApoE-specific differentially expressed inflammatory ChP genes. Treatment with beta-OHB reduced aortic plaque formation without affecting blood lipid profiles and decreased serum production of resistin, a well-established risk factor for both AD and atherosclerosis. Thus, the current study suggests and describes the therapeutic potential of beta-OHB for the treatment of AD and atherosclerosis.;The ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to reduce anxiety and enhance cognitive functions in neurological diseases. However, the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers (Cd68, P2ry12) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex-specific decrease in IL1beta and an increase in IL-10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1beta, and cFos. Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL-10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1beta from human microglia in in-vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male-specific. Reduced pro-inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects."

Indeed, gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolomic profile alterations, are hallmarks of IBD. In this scenario, metabolite-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), involved in several biological processes, have emerged as pivotal players in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of this study was to characterize the axis microbiota-metabolite-GPCR in intestinal surgical resections from IBD patients. Results showed that UC patients had a lower microbiota richness and bacterial load, with a higher proportion of the genus Cellulosimicrobium and a reduced proportion of Escherichia, whereas CD patients showed a decreased abundance of Enterococcus. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in carboxylic acids, fatty acids, and amino acids in UC and CD samples. These patients also exhibited upregulated expression of most metabolite-sensing GPCRs analysed, which positively correlated with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers. The role of GPR109A was studied in depth and increased expression of this receptor was detected in epithelial cells and cells from lamina propria, including CD68+ macrophages, in IBD patients. The treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate increased gene expression of GPR109A, CD86, IL1B and NOS2 in U937-derived macrophages. Besides, when GPR109A was transiently silenced, the mRNA expression and secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were impaired in M1 macrophages. Finally, the secretome from siGPR109A M1 macrophages reduced the gene and protein expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 in intestinal fibroblasts. A better understanding of metabolite-sensing GPCRs, such as GPR109A, could establish their potential as therapeutic targets for managing IBD."

To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM beta-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-beta1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. beta-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN.;The hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium is a key contributor to the occurrence and development of systemic inflammation. Although D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exhibits various protective effects, whether it affects the permeability of intestinal epithelium in systemic inflammation has not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effects of BHB on the intestinal epithelial permeability, the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the tight junction protein Claudin-1 in colon in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation mouse model. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS was used to induce systemic inflammation and BHB was given by oral administration. The permeability of intestinal epithelium, the morphological changes of colonic epithelium, the distribution and generation of colon E-cadherin, and the Claudin-1 generation and its epithelial distribution in colon were detected. The results confirmed the intestinal epithelial hyperpermeability and inflammatory changes in colonic epithelium, with disturbed E-cadherin distribution in LPS-treated mice. Besides, colon Claudin-1 generation was decreased and its epithelial distribution in colon was weakened in LPS-treated mice. However, BHB treatments alleviated the LPS-induced hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium, attenuated the colonic epithelial morphological changes and promoted orderly distribution of E-cadherin in colon. Furthermore, BHB up-regulated colon Claudin-1 generation and promoted its colonic epithelial distribution and content in LPS-treated mice. In conclusion, BHB may alleviate the hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium via up-regulation of Claudin-1 in colon in LPS-treated mice."

However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway.;BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility. The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates, has been applied clinically for the treatment of obese women with PCOS. We have previously demonstrated that KD improved the reproductive phenotype in an androgen-induced PCOS mouse model, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of KD on the reproductive phenotype of a letrozole-induced PCOS mouse model. METHODS: Female C57BL/6N mice were divided into three groups, designated control, letrozole, and letrozole + KD groups. Mice of control and letrozole groups were fed the control diet, whereas letrozole + KD mice were fed a KD with 89.9% (kcal) fat for 3 weeks after the PCOS mouse model was generated. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the most abundant ketone body in the body, was used to treat KGN cells with testosterone (T) to simulate the KD effect on PCOS mouse ovaries in vitro. RESULTS: Our data showed that KD treatment significantly increased blood ketone levels and reduced body weight. Ovarian functions were improved in some letrozole + KD mice. Results from in vitro experiments indicated mitochondrial damage owing to high T levels, which resulted in the leakage of cytochrome C and mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol and thus induced the activation of the intracellular caspase cascade and the cGAS-STING-NF-kappaB pathway, leading to granulosa cell inflammation and apoptosis. BHB exhibited certain protective effects on mitochondria of T-treated KGN cells via inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway. Moreover, the cGAS-STING pathway was activated in ovaries of letrozole mice and was down-regulated in letrozole + KD mice. CONCLUSION: These findings, for the first time, revealed that hyperandrogenism induced ovarian dysfunction possibly through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which could be partially inhibited by ketone bodies produced from KD administration."

METHODS: We employed a 7-week experimental design for a study on 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into five groups: (1) a control-diet fed group, (2) a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed group, (3) a group that received an HFD and a BHB solution in their drinking water, (4) a group that received an HFD with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin in their drinking water, and (5) a group that received an HFD and were also treated with the combination of BHB and melatonin. Following the treatment period, biochemical indices, gene expression levels of key thermogenic markers (including uncoupling protein 1 [UCP1], PR domain containing 16 [PRDM16], Cidea, fat-specific protein 27 [Fsp27], and metallothionein 1 [MT1]), and stereological assessments of BAT were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with BHB and melatonin significantly boosted blood ketone levels, improved lipid profiles, and reduced weight gain from an HFD. It also downregulated genes linked to WAT, namely, Cidea and Fsp27, and upregulated key BAT markers, including UCP1, PRDM16 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha. Additionally, the co-treatment increased MT1 receptor expression and enhanced the structural density of BAT. CONCLUSION: The combined oral administration of BHB and melatonin successfully prevented the whitening of BAT in obese rats fed an HFD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related BAT dysfunction. The synergistic effects of this treatment underscore the potential of a combined approach to address BAT dysfunction in obesity."

The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerts unique beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, but the involvement of BHB in promoting the generation of claudin-5 to attenuate cardiac microvascular hyperpermeability in diabetes is poorly understood. METHODS: The effects of BHB on cardiac microvascular endothelial hyperpermeability and claudin-5 generation were evaluated in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and in high glucose (HG)-stimulated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs). To explore the underlying mechanisms, we also measured beta-catenin nuclear translocation, binding of beta-catenin, histone deacetylase (HDAC)1, HDAC3 and p300 to the Claudin-5 (also known as CLDN5) promoter, interaction between HDAC3 and beta-catenin, and histone acetylation in the Claudin-5 promoter. RESULTS: We found that 10 weeks of BHB treatment promoted claudin-5 generation and antagonised cardiac microvascular endothelial hyperpermeability in rat models of diabetes. Meanwhile, BHB promoted claudin-5 generation and inhibited paracellular permeability in HG-stimulated HCMECs. Specifically, BHB (2 mmol/l) inhibited HG-induced HDAC3 from binding to the Claudin-5 promoter, although nuclear translocation or promoter binding of beta-catenin did not change with BHB treatment. In addition, BHB prevented the binding and co-localisation of HDAC3 to beta-catenin in HG-stimulated HCMECs. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry, acetylated H3K14 (H3K14ac) in the Claudin-5 promoter following BHB treatment was identified, regardless of whether cells were stimulated by HG or not. Although reduced levels of acetylated H3K9 in the Claudin-5 promoter were found following HG stimulation, increased H3K14ac was specifically associated with BHB treatment. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: BHB inhibited HDAC3 and caused acetylation of H3K14 in the Claudin-5 promoter, thereby promoting claudin-5 generation and antagonising diabetes-associated cardiac microvascular hyperpermeability. Graphical abstract.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC."

To date, all known pathways of BHB metabolism involve interconversion of BHB and primary energy intermediates. Here we show that CNDP2 controls a previously undescribed secondary BHB metabolic pathway via enzymatic conjugation of BHB and free amino acids. This BHB-ylation reaction produces a family of endogenous ketone metabolites, the BHB-amino acids. Genetic ablation of CNDP2 in mice eliminates tissue amino acid BHB-ylation activity and reduces BHB-amino acid levels. Administration of BHB-Phe, the most abundant BHB-amino acid, to obese mice activates neural populations in the hypothalamus and brainstem and suppresses feeding and body weight. Conversely, CNDP2-KO mice exhibit increased food intake and body weight upon ketosis stimuli. CNDP2-dependent amino acid BHB-ylation and BHB-amino acid metabolites are also conserved in humans. Therefore, the metabolic pathways of BHB extend beyond primary metabolism and include secondary ketone metabolites linked to energy balance."

The major form of ketone body is beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), which is metabolized by the proximal tubule. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and tubulopathy are important in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, the role of TGF-beta and the downstream Smad3 in beta-HB-induced effects in the human proximal tubule (HK-2 cell) was studied. METHODS: Effects of beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) on HK-2 cells were determined for: proliferation, cell cycle distribution, collagen production, tubular transdifferentiation [expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein], TGF-beta, Smad2/3, p21WAF1, and p27kip1. RESULTS: Beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) dose dependently decreased proliferation, arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours (without affecting p21WAF1/p27kip1 mRNA and transcription). beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein half-lives. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours and TGF-beta1 mRNA/bioactivity at 48 hours. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased nuclear Smad2/3 protein expression and increased collagen production (without affecting tubular transdifferentiation), which were reversed by Smad7, dominant-negative Smad3, and N-acetylcysteine. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours, and reversed TGF-beta1 bioactivity at 48 hours. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours. Finally, N-acetylcysteine, TGF-beta antibody, Smad7, and dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB (1 mmol/L)-induced growth inhibition at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Beta-HB activated Smad 2/3 by oxidative stress. TGF-beta and Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced cell cycle-dependent growth inhibition while Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced collagen production and p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression in HK-2 cells. Moreover, beta-HB increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression by increasing p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein stability.;Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM beta-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-beta1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. beta-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN.;INTRODUCTION: The ketogenic diet (KD), as a dietary intervention, has gained importance in the treatment of solid organ structural remodeling, but its role in renal fibrosis has not been explored. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a KD for 6 weeks prior to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-established in vivo model of renal fibrosis in rodents. Seven days after UUO, serum and kidney samples were collected. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) concentrations and renal fibrosis were assessed. NRK52E cells were treated with TGFbeta1, a fibrosis-inducing cytokine, and with or without beta-OHB, a ketone body metabolized by KD, to investigate the mechanism underlying renal fibrosis. RESULTS: KD significantly enhanced serum beta-OHB levels in mice. Histological analysis revealed that KD alleviated structural destruction and fibrosis in obstructed kidneys and reduced the expression of the fibrosis protein markers alpha-SMA, Col1a1, and Col3a1. Expression of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), Cpt1a and Acox1, significantly decreased after UUO and were upregulated by KD. However, the protective effect of KD was abolished by etomoxir (a Cpt1a inhibitor). Besides, our study observed that KD significantly suppressed UUO-induced macrophage infiltration and the expression of IL-6 in the obstructive kidneys. In NRK52E cells, fibrosis-related signaling was increased by TGFbeta1 and reduced by beta-OHB. beta-OHB treatment restored the impaired expression of Cpt1a. The effect of beta-OHB was blocked by siRNA targeting free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), suggesting that beta-OHB might function through the FFAR3-dependent pathway. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight that KD attenuates UUO-induced renal fibrosis by enhancing FAO via the FFAR3-dependent pathway, which provides a promising dietary therapy for renal fibrosis."

CT13 under abiotic stress.;Ketogenic beta-hydroxybutyrate regulates beta-hydroxybutyrylation of TCA cycle-associated enzymes and attenuates disease-associated pathologies in Alzheimer's mice.,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a typical carbon and energy storage compound, is widely found in Bacteria and Archae domains. This polymer is produced in response to conditions of physiological stress. PHB is composed of repeating units of beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-3HB). It has been previously shown that R-3HB functions as an osmolyte in extremophile strains. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. CT13, a halotolerant bacterium, and its PHB synthase-minus mutant (phaC) were used to analyze the chaperone role of R-3HB. The production of this compound was found to be essential to salt stress resistance and positively correlated with salt concentration, suggesting that PHB monomer acts as a compatible solute in Pseudomonas sp. CT13. R-3HB accumulation was also associated with the prevention of protein aggregation under combined salt and thermal stresses in Pseudomonas sp. CT13. Physiological concentrations of R-3HB efficiently reduced citrate synthase (CS) aggregation and stabilized the enzymatic activities of CS during thermal stress. Docking analysis of the CS/R-3HB interaction predicted the stability of this complex under physiological concentrations of R-3HB. Thus, in vivo, in vitro and in silico analyses suggest that R-3HB can act as a chemical chaperone.;Lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) is a post-translational modification that has recently been found to regulate protein functions. However, whether and how protein Kbhb modification participates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. Herein, we carried out 4D label-free beta-hydroxybutylation quantitative proteomics using brain samples of 8-month-old and 2-month-old APP/PS1 AD model mice and wild-type (WT) controls. We identified a series of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated enzymes including citrate synthase (CS) and succinate-CoA ligase subunit alpha (SUCLG1), whose Kbhb modifications were decreased in APP/PS1 mice at pathological stages. Sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (Na-beta-OHB) treatment markedly increased Kbhb modifications of CS and SUCLG1 and their enzymatic activities, leading to elevated ATP production. We further found that Kbhb modifications at lysine 393 site in CS and at lysine 81 site in SUCLG1 were crucial for their enzymatic activities. Finally, we found that beta-OHB levels were decreased in the brain of APP/PS1 mice at pathological stages. While ketogenic diet not only significantly increased beta-OHB levels, Kbhb modifications and enzymatic activities of CS and SUCLG1, and ATP production, but also dramatically attenuated beta-amyloid plaque pathologies and microgliosis in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our findings indicate the importance of protein Kbhb modification for maintaining normal TCA cycle and ATP production and provide a novel molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet on energy metabolism and AD intervention."

Hypertension (HTN) is the second leading risk factor for developing kidney disease. A recent study reported that increasing levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels by administration of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, decreased salt-induced HTN in male Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats. The effect of 1,3-butanediol on hypertensive kidney disease in female rats or the absence of high salt has not been investigated. This study tested the hypothesis that 1,3-butanediol attenuates HTN and the progression of CKD in female S-SHR(11) rats. The S-SHR(11) strain is a congenic rat strain generated from genetic modification of the Dahl S rat, previously characterized as a model of accelerated renal disease. Rats received 1,3-butanediol (20% via drinking water) or control for 10 wk and were maintained on a 0.3% NaCl rodent diet (n = 12-14 rats/group). Blood pressure was measured after 6 and 9 wk of treatment by tail-cuff plethysmography, after 10 wk, urine and tissues were collected. Activity of the treatment was confirmed by measuring plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, which were greater in the treated group. The 1,3-butanediol-treated group had lower systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, plasma creatinine, and renal fibrosis after 9 wk of treatment compared with controls. The treated group had significantly smaller spleens and increased the renal anti-inflammatory molecules interleukin-10 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, suggesting reduced inflammation. The present data demonstrate that 1,3-butanediol lowers blood pressure and renal injury in female rats and could be a novel nutritional intervention for the treatment of CKD."

Recent mouse studies have elucidated an anti-inflammatory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether BHB altered inflammatory responses in macrophages challenged with the common mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. A secondary objective was to determine whether the inflammatory response to the S. uberis challenge was dependent on whether BHB was present in the medium during the challenge (i.e., preconditioned vs. continuous treatment). Two cell culture experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 line) were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was then replaced with a standard cell culture medium, and the cells were challenged or not with S. uberis for an additional 6 h. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was used, however, cells were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of BHB, and cells were either challenged or not with S. uberis for 6 h. In both experiments, relative transcript abundance of cell membrane receptors (Tlr2 and Gpr109a), cytokines (Il1b, Il10, Tnf, and Tgfb1), and chemokines (Cxcl2 and Ccl5) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the geometric mean of Hprt and B2m. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model, and orthogonal contrasts were conducted to examine the effect of S. uberis challenge and BHB treatment. Streptococcus uberis activated the macrophages, noted by greater transcript abundance of analyzed genes. Intriguingly, in both experiments, the S. uberis challenge increased expression of Gpr109a, which encodes a receptor that is ligated by BHB. Paradoxically, preconditioning macrophages with BHB increased transcript abundance of the immunosuppressive cytokine Tgfb1 and increased that of the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl2. Preconditioning decreased Tlr2 and tended to decrease Il10 transcript abundance. In opposition to the preconditioning experiment, continuous treatment of BHB during the S. uberis challenge linearly increased abundance of Tlr2 and Il10 transcripts. Continuous BHB treatment also increased expression of Il1b. In conclusion, BHB treatment altered macrophage inflammatory responses during an S. uberis challenge, however, the direction of this response was dependent on whether BHB was added to the medium during the S. uberis challenge. Future studies should be conducted using bovine macrophages and in vivo approaches to examine BHB effects during an S. uberis challenge."

There remains a need for alternatives or complements to existing treatments that could control the physiologic manifestations of allergic asthma. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the hypothesis that because ketone bodies elicit anti-inflammatory activity and are effective in mitigating the methacholine hyperresponsiveness associated with obese asthma, increasing systemic concentrations of ketone bodies would diminish pathologic outcomes in asthma-relevant cell types and in mouse models of allergic asthma. METHODS: We explored the effects of ketone bodies on allergic asthma-relevant cell types (macrophages, airway epithelial cells, CD4 T cells, and bronchial smooth muscle cells) in vitro as well as in vivo by using preclinical models representative of several endotypes of allergic asthma to determine whether promotion of ketosis through feeding a ketogenic diet or providing a ketone precursor or a ketone ester dietary supplement could affect immune and inflammatory parameters as well as methacholine hyperresponsiveness. RESULTS: In a dose-dependent manner, the ketone bodies acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion from mouse macrophages and airway epithelial cells, decreased house dust mite (HDM) extract-induced IL-8 secretion from human airway epithelial cells, and decreased cytokine production from polyclonally and HDM-activated T cells. Feeding a ketogenic diet, providing a ketone body precursor, or supplementing the diet with a ketone ester increased serum BHB concentrations and decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness in several acute HDM sensitization and challenge models of allergic asthma. A ketogenic diet or ketone ester supplementation decreased methacholine hyperresponsiveness in an HDM rechallenge model of chronic allergic asthma. Ketone ester supplementation synergized with corticosteroid treatment to decrease methacholine hyperresponsiveness in an HDM-driven model of mixed-granulocytic severe asthma. HDM-induced morphologic changes in bronchial smooth muscle cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by BHB, as was HDM protease activity. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing systemic BHB concentrations through dietary interventions could provide symptom relief for several endotypes of allergic asthmatic individuals through effects on multiple asthma-relevant cells."

Addition of 4 mM Na D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, protected the cells for 2 hr and maintained the increase in survival compared to that of controls for up to 6 hr. Trypan blue exclusion indicated that acute cell death was reduced markedly after 2-hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group. The presence of bHB also decreased the number of neurons exhibiting condensed nuclei visualized by propidium iodide, indicative of apoptosis. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Em/c) was maintained for up to 2 hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group, whereas the potential in the control group was decreased. Furthermore, cytochrome C release, caspase-3 activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage were decreased in the bHB-treated group for the first 2 hr of exposure. These findings indicate that ketone bodies may be a candidate for widening the therapeutic window before thrombolytic therapy and at the same time decreasing apoptotic damage in the ischemic penumbra.;It has been postulated that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, provides models of PD both in vivo and in vitro. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, against rotenone toxicity by using SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y cells, differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid, were exposed to rotenone at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1,000 nM. We evaluated cellular oxidation reduction by the alamarBlue assay, viability by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and survival/death ratio by live/dead assays. Exposure to rotenone for 48 hr oxidized cells and decreased their viability and survival rate in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with 8 mM bHB provided significant protection to SH-SY5Y cells. Whereas rotenone caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome c into the cytosol, and reduced cytochrome c content in mitochondria, addition of bHB blocked this toxic effect. bHB also attenuated the rotenone-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Administration of 0-10 mM 3-nitropropionic acid, a complex II inhibitor, also decreased the reducing power of SH-SY5Y cells measured by alamarBlue assay. Pretreatment with 8 mM bHB attenuated the decrease of alamarBlue fluorescence. These data demonstrated that bHB had a neuroprotective effect that supported the mitochondrial respiration system by reversing the inhibition of complex I or II. Ketone bodies, the alternative energy source in the mammalian brain, appear to have therapeutic potential in PD.;The aim was to investigate whether the combination of hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac) and ethyl beta-hydroxybutyrate (HBET) can improve the cognition of heat-stressed mice, meanwhile exploring the mechanism of action. Mice were divided into 5 groups: control, heat-stressed, HT-ac, HBET, and HT-ac + HBET. Mice were gavaged for 21 days and exposed to heat (42.5 +/- 0.5  degrees C, RH 60 +/- 10%, 1 h day(-1)) on days 15-21, except for the control group. Results showed that the combination of HT-ac + HBET improved the cognitive and learning abilities of heat-stressed mice, which were tested by Morris water maze, shuttle box, and jumping stage tests. The combination of HT-ac + HBET maintained the integrity of neurons and mitochondria of heat-stressed mice. Likewise, this combination increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, the ATP content, the expression of phosphorylated PKA, BDNF, phosphorylated CREB and Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and intracytoplasmic Cyt C in heat-stressed mice."

Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

However, the role of beta-HB in the regulation of neurological injury after cardiac arrest (CA) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of beta-HB on brain mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological function after CA. A rat model of CA was established by asphyxia. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, control group, and beta-HB group. Animals received 200 mg/kg beta-HB or same volume vehicle at 10 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation by intraperitoneal injection. Neurological function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score and Y-maze. Neuronal cell loss and apoptosis were detected through hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Oxidative stress levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydoxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure of brain cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the protein expression levels of Bak, caspase 3, gasdermin D, caspase 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and phospho-Drp1 (ser616) were measured. We found that neurological function and survival rate were significantly higher in the beta-HB group compared with the control group. beta-HB also reduced neurons death and neurological oxidative stress after CA. Moreover, beta-HB reduced neurological injury from apoptosis and pyroptosis after CA. In addition, beta-HB maintained the structural integrity of brain mitochondria, prevented mitochondrial fission, and increased brain energy metabolism after CA. In conclusion, beta-HB beneficially affected the neurological function of rats after global cerebral ischemia, associated with decreased mitochondrial fission, and improved mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that beta-HB might benefit patients suffering from neurological dysfunction after CA."
ENSG00000146648,EGFR,0.33311483,weak,1,37974030,2024,,Higher beta-hydroxybutyrate ketone levels associated with a slower kidney function decline in ADPKD.,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulated energy metabolism is a recently discovered key feature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Cystic cells depend on glucose and are poorly able to use other energy sources such as ketone bodies. Raising ketone body concentration reduced disease progression in animal models of polycystic kidney diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that higher endogenous plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations are associated with reduced disease progression in patients with ADPKD. METHODS: We analyzed data from 670 patients with ADPKD participating in the Developing Intervention Strategies to Halt Progression of ADPKD (DIPAK) cohort, a multi-center prospective observational cohort study. BHB was measured at baseline using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants were excluded if they had type 2 diabetes, were using disease-modifying drugs (e.g. tolvaptan, somatostatin analogs), were not fasting or had missing BHB levels, leaving 521 participants for the analyses. Linear regression analyses were used to study cross-sectional associations and linear mixed-effect modeling for longitudinal associations. RESULTS: Of the participants, 61% were female, with an age of 47.3 +/- 11.8 years, a height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) of 834 [interquartile range (IQR) 495-1327] mL/m and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 63.3 +/- 28.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median concentration of BHB was 94 (IQR 68-147) micromol/L. Cross-sectionally, BHB was associated neither with eGFR nor with htTKV. Longitudinally, BHB was positively associated with eGFR slope B = 0.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.61], P = .007, but not with kidney growth. After adjustment for potential confounders, every doubling in BHB concentration was associated with an improvement in the annual rate of eGFR by 0.33 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.57, P = .008). CONCLUSION: These observational analyses support the hypothesis that interventions that raise BHB concentration could reduce the rate of kidney function decline in patients with ADPKD."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

The aim was to test the effects of sodium-ss-hydroxybutyrate (SBHB) infusion on brain injury in a clinically relevant swine model of CA. RESULTS: CA was electrically induced in 20 adult swine. After 10 min, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 5 min. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the animals were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of balanced crystalloid (controls, n = 11) or SBHB (theoretical osmolarity 1189 mOsm/l, n = 8) for 12 h. Multimodal neurological and cardiovascular monitoring were implemented in all animals. Nineteen of the 20 animals achieved ROSC. Blood sodium concentrations, osmolarity and circulating KBs were higher in the treated animals than in the controls. SBHB infusion was associated with significantly lower plasma biomarkers of brain injury at 6 (glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP and neuron specific enolase, NSE) and 12 h (neurofilament light chain, NFL, GFAP and NSE) compared to controls. The amplitude of the stereoelectroencephalograph (sEEG) increased in treated animals after ROSC compared to controls. Cerebral glucose uptake was lower in treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental model, SBHB infusion after resuscitated CA was associated with reduced circulating markers of cerebral injury and increased sEEG amplitude."

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of ketone monoester ingestion on postexercise erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations. Nine healthy men completed two trials in a randomized, crossover design (1-wk washout). During trials, participants performed 1 h of cycling (initially alternating between 50% and 90% of maximal aerobic capacity for 2 min each interval, and then 50% and 80%, and 50% and 70% when the higher intensity was unsustainable). Participants ingested 0.8 g.kg(-1) sucrose with 0.4 g.kg(-1) protein immediately after exercise, and at 1, 2, and 3 h postexercise. During the control trial (CONTROL), no further nutrition was provided, whereas on the ketone monoester trial (KETONE), participants also ingested 0.29 g.kg(-1) of the ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate immediately postexercise and at 1 and 2 h postexercise. Blood was sampled immediately postexercise, every 15 min in the first hour and hourly thereafter for 4 h. Serum EPO concentrations increased to a greater extent in KETONE than in CONTROL (time x condition interaction: P = 0.046). Peak serum EPO concentrations were higher with KETONE (means +/- SD: 9.0 +/- 2.3 IU.L(-1)) compared with CONTROL (7.5 +/- 1.5 IU.L(-1), P < 0.01). Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were also higher, and glucose concentrations lower, with KETONE versus CONTROL (both P < 0.01). In conclusion, ketone monoester ingestion increases postexercise erythropoietin concentrations, revealing a new avenue for orally ingestible ketone monoesters to potentially alter hemoglobin mass.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To our knowledge, this study was the first to assess the effects of ketone monoester ingestion on erythropoietin concentrations after exercise. We demonstrated that ingestion of a ketone monoester postexercise increased serum erythropoietin concentrations and reduced serum glucose concentrations in healthy men. These data reveal the possibility for ketone monoesters to alter hemoglobin mass.;The objective of this study was to examine the effect of consuming ketone monoester plus a high dose of carbohydrate from glucose (KE + CHO) on the change in erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations during load carriage exercise compared with carbohydrate (CHO) alone. Using a randomized, crossover design, 12 males consumed KE + CHO (573 mg KE/kg body mass, 110 g glucose) or CHO (110 g glucose) 30 min before 4 miles of self-paced treadmill exercise (KE + CHO:51 +/- 13%, CHO: 52 +/- 12% V̇O(2peak)) wearing a weighted vest (30% body mass, 25 +/- 3 kg). Blood samples for analysis were obtained under resting fasted conditions before (Baseline) consuming the KE + CHO or CHO supplement and immediately after exercise (Post). betaHB increased (p < 0.05) from Baseline to Post in KE + CHO, with no change in CHO. Glucose and glycerol increased (p < 0.05) from Baseline to Post in CHO, with no effect of time in KE + CHO. Insulin and lactate increased (p < 0.05) from Baseline to Post independent of treatment. EPO increased (p < 0.05) from Baseline to Post in KE + CHO and CHO with no difference between treatments. Although KE + CHO altered betaHB, glucose, and glycerol concentrations, results from this study suggest that KE + CHO supplementation before load carriage exercise does not enhance immediate post-exercise increases in EPO compared with CHO alone."

However, the long-term safety of the KD and the underlying mechanism by which it delays OA remain unclear. We found that while long-term KD could ameliorate OA, it induced severe hepatic steatosis in mice. Consequently, we developed 2 versions of ketogenic-based diets: KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD. Both KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD effectively alleviated OA by significantly reducing the levels of inflammatory cytokines, cartilage loss, sensory nerve sprouting, and knee hyperalgesia without inducing hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), a convenient energy carrier produced by adipocytes, could ameliorate OA without causing liver lesions. Mechanistically, beta-HB enhanced chondrocyte autophagy and reduced apoptosis through the activation of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) signaling pathway, a pathway which was down-regulated in the articular chondrocytes from both OA patients and mice. Collectively, our findings highlighted the potential therapeutic value of beta-HB and KD supplemented with vitamin D and intermittent KD approaches for managing OA."

The present study sought to investigate whether a ketogenic diet also improves insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle cells through alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. METHODS: High-fat diet-induced IR mice were allowed to a 2-week ketogenic diet. Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were evaluated through GTT, ITT, and HOMA-IR. The C2C12 myoblasts exposed to palmitic acid were used to evaluate the insulin sensitization effects of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB). Molecular mechanisms concerning ER stress signaling activation and glucose uptake were assessed. RESULTS: The AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited, ER stress signaling associated with IRE1, PERK, and BIP was activated, and the number of Glut4 proteins translocated to membrane decreased in the muscle of HFD mice. However, all these changes were reversed after 2 weeks of feeding on a ketogenic diet. Consistently in C2C12 myoblasts, the AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, IRE1, and BIP were increased, and the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane decreased. However, beta-OHB treatment alleviated ER stress and improved the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that KD ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, which was partially mediated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. The insulin sensitization effect of beta-OHB is associated with up regulation of AKT/GSK3beta pathway and the increase in the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane."

Whether white adipose tissue plays a role in effects of acute nutritional ketosis is largely unknown. Objective: To investigate the effects of acute nutritional ketosis on plasma levels of asprosin and leptin and if they are affected by abdominal fat phenotypes. Methods: The design was a randomised crossover trial. Participants received either the D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (KEbetaHB) drink or placebo drink. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes. 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes (VFV and SFV, respectively), intra-hepatic fat deposition (IHFD), and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). Results: A total of 18 adults were randomised, with no drop-outs. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of asprosin and leptin (p = 0.808 and p = 0.907, respectively) between the KEbetaHB and placebo drinks. There was no effect of time, treatment, or interaction between time and treatment on asprosin and leptin. After stratification by the VFV/SFV ratio, IHFD, and IPFD, there were no differences in asprosin and leptin between the KEbetaHB and placebo drinks. Conclusion: Plasma levels of asprosin and leptin were not significantly affected by acute nutritional ketosis. Abdominal fat phenotypes did not significantly affect circulating levels of the two hormones. White adipose tissue does not appear to play a role in altering hormone levels during acute nutritional ketosis. The clinical trial registry number is NCT03889210 (https://clinicaltrials.gov)."

METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a KD for 6 weeks prior to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a well-established in vivo model of renal fibrosis in rodents. Seven days after UUO, serum and kidney samples were collected. Serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) concentrations and renal fibrosis were assessed. NRK52E cells were treated with TGFbeta1, a fibrosis-inducing cytokine, and with or without beta-OHB, a ketone body metabolized by KD, to investigate the mechanism underlying renal fibrosis. RESULTS: KD significantly enhanced serum beta-OHB levels in mice. Histological analysis revealed that KD alleviated structural destruction and fibrosis in obstructed kidneys and reduced the expression of the fibrosis protein markers alpha-SMA, Col1a1, and Col3a1. Expression of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), Cpt1a and Acox1, significantly decreased after UUO and were upregulated by KD. However, the protective effect of KD was abolished by etomoxir (a Cpt1a inhibitor). Besides, our study observed that KD significantly suppressed UUO-induced macrophage infiltration and the expression of IL-6 in the obstructive kidneys. In NRK52E cells, fibrosis-related signaling was increased by TGFbeta1 and reduced by beta-OHB. beta-OHB treatment restored the impaired expression of Cpt1a. The effect of beta-OHB was blocked by siRNA targeting free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), suggesting that beta-OHB might function through the FFAR3-dependent pathway. DISCUSSION: Our results highlight that KD attenuates UUO-induced renal fibrosis by enhancing FAO via the FFAR3-dependent pathway, which provides a promising dietary therapy for renal fibrosis.;Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity is mediated by elevated catecholamine (CA) secretion from the adrenal medulla, as well as enhanced norepinephrine (NE) release from peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals. Adrenal CA production from chromaffin cells is tightly regulated by sympatho-inhibitory alpha(2)-adrenergic (auto)receptors (ARs), which inhibit both epinephrine (Epi) and NE secretion via coupling to Gi/o proteins. alpha(2)-AR function is, in turn, regulated by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinases (GRKs), especially GRK2, which phosphorylate and desensitize them, i.e., uncouple them from G proteins. On the other hand, the short-chain free fatty acid (SCFA) receptor (FFAR)-3, also known as GPR41, promotes NE release from sympathetic neurons via the Gi/o-derived free Gbetagamma-activated phospholipase C (PLC)-beta/Ca(2+) signaling pathway. However, whether it exerts a similar effect in adrenal chromaffin cells is not known at present. In the present study, we examined the interplay of the sympatho-inhibitory alpha(2A)-AR and the sympatho-stimulatory FFAR3 in the regulation of CA secretion from rat adrenal chromaffin (pheochromocytoma) PC12 cells. We show that FFAR3 promotes CA secretion, similarly to what GRK2-dependent alpha(2A)-AR desensitization does. In addition, FFAR3 activation enhances the effect of the physiologic stimulus (acetylcholine) on CA secretion. Importantly, GRK2 blockade to restore alpha(2A)-AR function or the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB or 3-hydroxybutyrate), via FFAR3 antagonism, partially suppress CA production, when applied individually. When combined, however, CA secretion from PC12 cells is profoundly suppressed. Finally, propionate-activated FFAR3 induces leptin and adiponectin secretion from PC12 cells, two important adipokines known to be involved in tissue inflammation, and this effect of FFAR3 is fully blocked by the ketone BHB. In conclusion, SCFAs can promote CA and adipokine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells via FFAR3 activation, but the metabolite/ketone body BHB can effectively inhibit this action.;Asthma is a common airway condition causing breathing difficulties due to reversible airflow obstruction. It often affects obese individuals, with symptoms triggered by environmental factors that induce immune responses, leading to inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) plays a central role in airway narrowing, driven by type 2 immune responses involving cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, along with leukocytes including eosinophils and type 2 T-helper cells. These responses cause structural changes such as fibrosis and airway thickening, while BSM cells worsen asthma by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to allergens, microbial signals, or inflammatory cytokines from other cells. While current treatments manage asthma in most patients, alternative therapies are needed for difficult-to-treat cases, particularly prevalent in obese, allergic individuals. Emerging research suggests that therapeutic ketosis, induced by dietary changes or ketone supplementation, may reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. The primary ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), produced during carbohydrate scarcity, acts via cell-surface receptors and transporters, potentially mitigating asthma symptoms. Weight loss and caloric restriction increase ketone levels, correlating with reduced inflammation and improved asthma outcomes. We hypothesized that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) reduces bronchoconstriction and inflammation in asthma by targeting bronchial smooth muscle. Using human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMC) in vitro, we demonstrate herein that BHB suppresses IL-1beta-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production through Free Fatty Acid Receptor 3 (FFAR3) activation. These findings suggest that bronchial smooth muscle is a key target of therapeutic ketosis, supporting BHB's potential benefits in preclinical asthma models.;Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation, remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness to triggers causing airway constriction. Bronchial smooth muscle plays a critical role by narrowing airways, leading to obstruction and breathing difficulties, often exacerbated by mast cell infiltration and histamine release. Whereas current treatments, including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and biologics provide effective management for most patients, alternative therapies are needed for difficult-to-treat asthma. Recent research highlights the potential of therapeutic ketosis, achieved through dietary interventions or supplementation with exogenous ketones, to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Ketone bodies, known for providing energy during carbohydrate scarcity, also influence asthma by activating cell-surface receptors and transporters. In vivo, interventions like weight loss and caloric restriction increase ketone body levels, correlating with improved asthma symptoms, reduced oxidative stress, and inflammation. These effects suggest ketone bodies, particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate, may play a therapeutic role in mitigating bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle contraction in asthma. We utilize human bronchial smooth muscle cells (in vitro) and mouse precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) (ex vivo) to assess the effects of BHB on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Brightfield microscopy showed that BHB reduces contraction in human bronchial smooth muscle cells, an effect involving free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3) activation. Light microscopy of PCLS revealed that BHB inhibits airway narrowing and cellular extrusion, demonstrating its ability to mitigate bronchoconstriction by suppressing smooth muscle contraction. These results implicate bronchial smooth muscle as a cellular target of therapeutic ketosis, an important contributor to the beneficial effects of BHB in preclinical models of asthma."

However, it is unclear how this critical trait is acquired and regulated. We demonstrate that under the control of PPARalpha, the genes required for lipid catabolism are transcribed before birth so that the neonatal liver has a prompt capacity to extract energy from milk upon suckling. The mechanism involves a fetal glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-PPARalpha axis in which GR directly regulates the transcriptional activation of PPARalpha by binding to its promoter. Certain PPARalpha target genes such as Fgf21 remain repressed in the fetal liver and become PPARalpha responsive after birth following an epigenetic switch triggered by beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated inhibition of HDAC3. This study identifies an endocrine developmental axis in which fetal GR primes the activity of PPARalpha in anticipation of the sudden shifts in postnatal nutrient source and metabolic demands.;Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is secreted by hepatocytes as a peptide hormone to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. FGF21 promotes hepatic ketogenesis and increases ketone body utilization in starvation. Histones are the target molecules of nutrients in regulating hepatic metabolic homeostasis. However, the effect of ketone bodies on FGF21 expression and the involvement of histones in it is not clear yet. The present study observed the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), the main physiological ketone body, on FGF21 expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells in vitro and in mice in vivo, and the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in beta-OHB-regulated FGF21 expression was investigated. The results showed that beta-OHB significantly upregulated FGF21 gene expression and increased FGF21 protein levels while it inhibited HDACs' activity in HepG2 cells. HDACs' inhibition by entinostat upregulated FGF21 expression and eliminated beta-OHB-stimulated FGF21 expression in HepG2 cells. Intraperitoneal injections of beta-OHB in mice resulted in the elevation of serum beta-OHB and the inhibition of hepatic HDACs' activity. Meanwhile, hepatic FGF21 expression and serum FGF21 levels were significantly increased in beta-OHB-treated mice compared with the control. It is suggested that beta-OHB upregulates FGF21 expression through inhibition of HDACs' activity in hepatocytes.;INTRODUCTION: Despite evidence suggesting that metabolic intermediates like beta-HB influence white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolism, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) on the fat browning program and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models. We assessed the effects of beta-HB on fat browning in adipocytes using 3T3-L1 cells and rat models. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of beta-HB on fat browning, thermogenesis, lipid accumulation, adipokine expression, and mitochondrial biogenesis by treating mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with sodium beta-HB for 24 h or by continuously exposing preadipocytes to beta-HB during the 8-day differentiation process. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, exercise only (EX), ketogenic diet only (KD), and combined exercise and ketogenic diet (KE) groups for an 8-week intervention involving diet and/or exercise. After intervention, we evaluated WAT histology, plasma lipids and adipokines, and the expression of markers related to fat browning, thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT of rats. RESULTS: In our adipocyte culture experiments, beta-HB reduced intracellular lipid accumulation by enhancing lipolysis and stimulated the expression of thermogenic and fat browning genes like uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and adipokines such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FDNC5). Additionally, beta-HB activated the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway, with UCP1 and PRDM16 upregulation mediated by beta-HB intracellular action and SIRT1 activity. In animal experiments, KE group raised beta-HB levels, decreasing body weight and blood lipids. KD with EX promoted WAT browning possibly via AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha, augmenting PRDM16, UCP1, FGF21, and FNDC5 expression. CONCLUSION: beta-HB induction via KD and/or EX shows potential in promoting WAT browning by activating mitochondrial biogenesis, lipolysis, and thermogenesis, suggesting that dietary and physical intervention inducing beta-HB may benefit metabolic health."

Serum FGF23 is correlated with outcomes in several diseases. Fasting stimulates the production of ketone bodies. We hypothesized that fasting can induce FGF23 synthesis through the production of ketone bodies. METHODS: UMR106 cells and isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) were treated with ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate. Mice were fasted overnight, fed ad libitum, or treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate. Proteins and further blood parameters were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), western blotting, immunohistochemistry, fluorometric or colorimetric methods, and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: beta-Hydroxybutyrate stimulated FGF23 production in UMR106 cells in a nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NFkappaB)-dependent manner, and in NRVMs. Compared to fed animals, fasted mice exhibited higher beta-hydroxybutyrate and FGF23 serum levels (based on assays either detecting C-terminal or intact, biologically active FGF23 only), cardiac, pancreatic, and thymic Fgf23 and renal Cyp24a1 expression, and lower 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) serum concentration as well as renal Slc34a1 and alphaKlotho (Kl) expression. In contrast, Fgf23 expression in bone and serum phosphate, calcium, plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration, and renal Cyp27b1 expression were not significantly affected by fasting. CONCLUSION: Short-term fasting increased FGF23 production, as did administration of beta-hydroxybutyrate, effects possibly of clinical relevance in view of the increasing use of FGF23 as a surrogate parameter in clinical monitoring of diseases. The fasting state of patients might therefore affect FGF23 tests."

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in kidneys is driven by regulated expression of fibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Yam, or Dioscorea alata (DA) is an important herb in Chinese medicine widely used for the treatment of clinical diabetes mellitus. However, the fibrosis regulatory effect of DA is unclear. Thus, we examined TGF-beta signaling mechanisms against EMT in rat fibroblast cells (NRK-49F). The characterization of DA water-extracts used various methods, after inducing cellular fibrosis in NRK-49F cells by treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) (10 mM), we used Western blotting to examine the protein expression in the TGF-beta-related signal protein type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, Smads2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3), pSmad2 and Smad3 (pSmad2/3), Smads4, Smads7, and EMT markers. These markers included E-cadherin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Bioactive TGF-beta and fibronectin levels in the culture media were determined using ELISA. Expressions of fibronectin and Snail transcription factor, an EMT-regulatory transcription factor, were assessed by immunofluorescence staining. DA extract dose-dependently (50-200 microg/mL) suppressed beta-HB-induced expression of fibronectin in NRK-49F cells concomitantly with the inhibition of Smad2/3, pSmad2/3, and Smad4. By contrast, Smad7 expression was significantly increased. DA extract caused a decrease in alpha-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin) and MMP-2 levels, and an increase in E-cadherin expression. We propose that DA extract might act as a novel fibrosis antagonist, which acts partly by down regulating the TGF-beta/smad signaling pathway and modulating EMT expression.;BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Adipose tissue contains progenitor cells that contribute to beneficial tissue expansion when needed by de novo adipocyte formation (classical white or beige fat cells with thermogenic potential). However, in chronic obesity, they can exhibit an activated pro-fibrotic, extracellular matrix (ECM)-depositing phenotype that highly aggravates obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. METHODS: Given that progenitors' fibrotic activation and fat cell browning appear to be antagonistic cell fates, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of pro-browning agents in an obesogenic condition. RESULTS: In obese mice fed a high fat diet, thermoneutral housing, which induces brown fat cell dormancy, increases the expression of ECM gene programs compared to conventionally raised animals, indicating aggravation of obesity-related tissue fibrosis at thermoneutrality. In a model of primary cultured murine adipose progenitors, we found that exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate selectively reduced Tgfbeta-dependent profibrotic responses of ECM genes like Ctgf, Loxl2 and Fn1. This effect is observed in both subcutaneous and visceral-derived adipose progenitors, as well as in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In 30 patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery, those with higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels have lower subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrotic scores. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate limits Tgfbeta-dependent collagen accumulation and reduces Smad2-3 protein expression and phosphorylation in visceral progenitors. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate induces the expression of the ZFP36 gene, encoding a post-transcriptional regulator that promotes the degradation of mRNA by binding to AU-rich sites within 3'UTRs. Importantly, complete ZFP36 deficiency in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line from null mice, or siRNA knock-down in primary progenitors, indicate that ZFP36 is required for beta-hydroxybutyrate anti-fibrotic effects. CONCLUSION: These data unravel the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate to limit adipose tissue matrix deposition, a finding that might exploited in an obesogenic context."

However, the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers (Cd68, P2ry12) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex-specific decrease in IL1beta and an increase in IL-10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1beta, and cFos. Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL-10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1beta from human microglia in in-vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male-specific. Reduced pro-inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects."

In this study, we investigated whether renal aging-related inflammation is modulated by HB. We compared aged rats administered with HB to calorie restricted rats and examined the modulation of FoxO1 and the NF-kappaB pathway through interactions with PGC-1alpha. We found that in aged rats treated with HB, pro-inflammatory signaling changes were reversed and showed effects comparable to CR. As FoxO1 and its target genes catalase/MnSOD were upregulated by HB treatment and PGC-1alpha selectively interacted with FoxO1, not with NF-kappaB, and ameliorated the renal inflammatory response. These findings were further confirmed using FoxO1 overexpression and siRNA transfection in vitro. Our findings suggest that HB suppressed aging-related inflammation as a CR mimetic by enabling the co-activation and selective interaction between FoxO1 and PGC-1alpha. This study demonstrates the potential therapeutic role of HB as a CR mimetic, which ameliorates inflammation by a novel mechanism where FoxO1 outcompetes NF-kappaB by interacting with PGC-1alpha in aging kidneys.;Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major challenge in liver surgery. Diet restriction reduces liver damage by increasing stress resistance, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the preventive effect of 12-h fasting on mouse liver IRI. Partial warm hepatic IRI model in wild-type male C57BL/6 mice was used. The control ischemia and reperfusion (IR) group of mice was given food and water ad libitum, while the fasting IR group was given water but not food for 12 h before ischemic insult. In 12-h fasting mice, serum liver-derived enzyme level and tissue damages due to IR were strongly suppressed. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was significantly raised before ischemia and during reperfusion. Up-regulated BHB induced an increment in the expression of FOXO1 transcription factor by raising the level of acetylated histone. Antioxidative enzyme heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a target gene of FOXO1, then increased. Autophagy activity was also enhanced. Serum high-mobility group box 1 was remarkably lowered by the 12-h fasting, and activation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production and liver injury were reduced. Exogenous BHB administration or histone deacetylase inhibitor administration into the control fed mice ameliorated liver IRI, while FOXO1 inhibitor administration to the 12-h fasting group exacerbated liver IRI. The 12-h fasting exerted beneficial effects on the prevention of liver IRI by increasing BHB, thus up-regulating FOXO1 and HO-1, and by reducing the inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death via the down-regulation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome.;Glycogen has long been considered to have a function in energy metabolism. However, our recent study indicated that glycogen metabolism, directed by cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Pck1, controls the formation and maintenance of CD8(+) memory T (T(mem)) cells by regulating redox homeostasis(1). This unusual metabolic program raises the question of how Pck1 is upregulated in CD8(+) T(mem) cells. Here, we show that mitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A is diverted to the ketogenesis pathway, which indirectly regulates Pck1 expression. Mechanistically, ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate is present in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, beta-hydroxybutyrate epigenetically modifies Lys 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) of Foxo1 and Ppargc1a (which encodes PGC-1alpha) with beta-hydroxybutyrylation, upregulating the expression of these genes. As a result, FoxO1 and PGC-1alpha cooperatively upregulate Pck1 expression, therefore directing the carbon flow along the gluconeogenic pathway to glycogen and the pentose phosphate pathway. These results reveal that ketogenesis acts as an unusual metabolic pathway in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, linking epigenetic modification required for memory development.;The O subfamily of forkhead (FoxO) 1 may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular endothelial injury. However, it is unknown whether D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) regulates cardiac microvascular endothelial FoxO1 to play protective roles in diabetes. In the study, limb microvascular morphological changes, endothelial distribution of the tight junction protein Claudin-5 and FoxO1, and FoxO1 content in limb tissue from clinical patients were evaluated. Then the effects of BHB on cardiac microvascular morphological changes, cardiac FoxO1 generation and its microvascular distribution in diabetic rats were measured. And the effects of BHB on FoxO1 generation in high glucose (HG)-stimulated human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) were further analyzed. The results firstly confirmed the enhanced limb microvascular FoxO1 distribution, with reduced Claudin-5 and endothelial injury in clinical patients. Then the elevated FoxO1 generation and its enhanced cardiac microvascular distribution were verified in diabetic rats and HG-stimulated HCMECs. However, BHB inhibited the enhanced cardiac FoxO1 generation and its microvascular distribution with attenuation of endothelial injury in diabetic rats. Furthermore, BHB reduced the HG-stimulated mRNA expression and protein content of FoxO1 in HCMECs. In conclusion, BHB reduced the enhanced cardiac microvascular endothelial FoxO1 to play protective roles in diabetic rats and HG-stimulated HCMECs.;Mitochondrial activity and quality control are essential for neuronal homeostasis as neurons rely on glucose oxidative metabolism. The ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), is metabolized to acetyl-CoA in brain mitochondria and used as an energy fuel alternative to glucose. We have previously reported that D-BHB sustains ATP production and stimulates the autophagic flux under glucose deprivation in neurons, however, the effects of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover under physiological conditions are still unknown. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD(+)-activated protein deacetylases involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy through the activation of transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3a, TFEB and PGC1alpha coactivator. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover in cultured neurons and the mechanisms involved. Results show that D-BHB increased mitochondrial membrane potential and regulated the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. D-BHB enhanced FOXO1, FOXO3a and PGC1alpha nuclear levels in an SIRT2-dependent manner and stimulated autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects increased neuronal resistance to energy stress. D-BHB also stimulated the autophagic-lysosomal pathway through AMPK activation and TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis. Upregulation of SIRT2, FOXOs, PGC1alpha and TFEB was confirmed in the brain of ketogenic diet (KD)-treated mice. Altogether, the results identify SIRT2, for the first time, as a target of D-BHB in neurons, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control."

Circulating levels of ketone bodies have been previously reported to be increased in patients with congestive heart failure (HF). In this study, we investigated regulatory mechanism and pathophysiological role of betaOHB in HF. First, we revealed that betaOHB level was elevated in failing hearts, but not in blood, using pressure-overloaded mice. We also measured cellular betaOHB levels in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes stimulated with or without H2O2 and revealed that increased myocardial betaOHB was derived from cardiomyocytes but not non-cardiomyocytes under pathological states. Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms of myocardial betaOHB elevation and its implication under pathological states. The gene and protein expression levels of CoA transferase (SCOT), a key enzyme involved in ketone body oxidation, was decreased in failing hearts. In cardiomyocytes, H2O2 stimulation caused betaOHB accumulation concomitantly with SCOT downregulation, implying that the accumulation of myocardial betaOHB occurs because of the decline in its utilization. Finally, we checked the effects of betaOHB on cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress. We found that betaOHB induced FOXO3a, an oxidative stress resistance gene, and its target enzyme, SOD2 and catalase. Consequently, betaOHB attenuated reactive oxygen species production and alleviated apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. It has been reported that hyperadrenergic state in HF boost lipolysis and result in elevation of circulating free fatty acids, which can lead hepatic ketogenesis for energy metabolism alteration. The present findings suggest that the accumulation of betaOHB also occurs as a compensatory response against oxidative stress in failing hearts.;Ketone bodies including beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) have been shown to protect against ischemic tissue injury when present at low concentrations. We evaluated the impact of beta-OHB on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Mice were treated with a continuous infusion of beta-OHB using an osmotic mini-pump before and after IRI. We also tested the effects of increasing endogenous serum beta-OHB levels by fasting. Renal IRI was attenuated by beta-OHB treatment compared to saline control, with similar results in the fasting condition. beta-OHB treatment reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and increased expression of forkhead transcription factor O3 (FOXO3), an upstream regulator of pyroptosis. Although beta-OHB treatment did not impact markers of apoptosis, it decreased the expression of caspase-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that beta-OHB blocked pyroptosis. In a human proximal tubular cell line exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, beta-OHB reduced cell death in a FOXO3-dependent fashion. Histone acetylation was decreased in kidneys exposed to IRI and in proximal tubular cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and this effect was ameliorated by beta-OHB through the inactivation of histone deacetylases. In vitro, beta-OHB treatment restored histone acetylation at the FOXO3 promoter. Consistent with epigenetic molecular effects, the renoprotective effects of beta-OHB were still observed when the continuous infusion was stopped at the time of IRI. Thus, beta-OHB attenuates renal IRI through anti-pyroptotic effects, likely mediated by an epigenetic effect on FOXO3 expression."

METHODS: A two-hit model with a high-fat diet (HFD) and N(omega)-nitrol-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was used as an HFpEF model. The treatment group received a weekly intraperitoneal injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Cardiac function, inflammation, and fibrosis were evaluated. CD3(+)CD4(+)Foxp3(+) positive cells within the myocardium were quantified by flow cytometry. The NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) pathway was examined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: BHB improved diastolic function, fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in HFpEF. Additionally, BHB inhibited cardiac inflammation and increased cardiac Treg cells, which could be due to the downregulation of the NOX2/GSK-3beta pathway. CONCLUSION: BHB protected against the progression of HFpEF by increasing cardiac Treg cells by modulating the NOX2/GSK-3beta pathway.;Increasing attention is being paid to the mechanistic investigation of exercise-associated chronic inflammatory disease improvement. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease with increasing incidence and prevalence worldwide. It is known that regular moderate aerobic exercise (RMAE) reduces the incidence or risk of UC, and attenuates disease progression in UC patients. However, the mechanisms of this RMAE's benefit are still under investigation. Here, we revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), a metabolite upon prolonged aerobic exercise, could contribute to RMAE preconditioning in retarding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis. When blocking beta-HB production, RMAE preconditioning-induced colitis amelioration was compromised, whereas supplementation of beta-HB significantly rescued impaired beta-HB production-associated defects. Meanwhile, we found that RMAE preconditioning significantly caused decreased colonic Th17/Treg ratio, which is considered to be important for colitis mitigation, and the downregulated Th17/Treg ratio was associated with beta-HB. We further demonstrated that beta-HB can directly promote the differentiation of Treg cell rather than inhibit Th17 cell generation. Furthermore, beta-HB increased forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) expression, the core transcriptional factor for Treg cell, by enhancing histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved noncoding sequences of the Foxp3 locus. In addition, fatty acid oxidation, the key metabolic pathway required for Treg cell differentiation, was enhanced by beta-HB treatment. Lastly, administration of beta-HB without exercise significantly boosted colonic Treg cell and alleviated colitis in mice. Together, we unveiled a previously unappreciated role for exercise metabolite beta-HB in the promotion of Treg cell generation and RMAE preconditioning-associated colitis attenuation."
ENSG00000140718,FTO,0.4587627,weak,1,29771336,2019,Brain/CNS,FTO is a transcriptional repressor to auto-regulate its own gene and potentially associated with homeostasis of body weight.,"Fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein is a ferrous ion (Fe2+)/2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent demethylase preferentially catalyzing m6A sites in RNA. The FTO gene is highly expressed in the hypothalamus with fluctuation in response to various nutritional conditions, which is believed to be involved in the control of whole body metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism in response to different nutritional cues remains poorly understood. Here we show that ketogenic diet-derived ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) transiently increases FTO expression in both mouse hypothalamus and cultured cells. Interestingly, the FTO protein represses Fto promoter activity, which can be offset by BHB. We then demonstrate that FTO binds to its own gene promoter, and Fe2+, but not 2-OG, impedes this binding and increases FTO expression. The BHB-induced occupancy of the promoter by FTO influences the assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery. Importantly, a loss-of-function FTO mutant (I367F), which induces a lean phenotype in FTOI367F mice, exhibits augmented binding and elevated potency to repress the promoter. Furthermore, FTO fails to bind to its own promoter that promotes FTO expression in the hypothalamus of high-fat diet-induced obese and 48-h fasting mice, suggesting a disruption of the stable expression of this gene. Taken together, this study uncovers a new function of FTO as a Fe2+-sensitive transcriptional repressor dictating its own gene switch to form an auto-regulatory loop that may link with the hypothalamic control of body weight."

FRDA is caused by decreased expression and/or function of the protein frataxin. Frataxin chaperones iron in the mitochondrial matrix and regulates the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly complex. ISCs are prosthetic groups critical for the function of the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Decreased expression of frataxin is associated with decreased ISC assembly, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and increased oxidative stress, all of which contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. In media with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as carbon source, primary FRDA fibroblasts grow poorly and/or lose viability over several days. We screened a random, short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA)-expressing library in primary FRDA fibroblasts and identified two shRNAs that reverse the growth/viability defect in BHB media. One of these two clones increases frataxin expression in primary FRDA fibroblasts, either as a vector-expressed shRNA or as a transfected short-interfering RNA (siRNA)."

METHODS: Mice were fed a KD for 4 wk and then subjected to cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The HT22 cells after beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) treatment were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Survival and neurologic function were measured after return of spontaneous circulation. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scanning, (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis, and seahorse assay were performed to explore the mechanism underlying the phenotype. RESULTS: Results of this study demonstrated that KD improved neurologic function and reduced apoptotic neurons in cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation mice. With no alteration of glucose uptake, KD suppressed glucose oxidation in mouse brain. Consistently, the glycolytic capacity of the HT22 cells was also downregulated by beta-OHB treatment. Moreover, KD increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate/oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione couples and reduced reactive oxygen species in the brain, probably due to activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of pentose phosphate pathway totally abolished the influence of beta-OHB on glycolysis, and post-oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation cell viability and reactive oxygen species production in HT22 cells. CONCLUSION: KD improved survival and attenuated post-cardiac arrest brain injury, which was mediated by upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway and related antioxidant defense system."

However, the metabolic/cell biologic mechanisms by which the KD exerts its antiepileptic efficacy remain elusive. Herein, we report that KD-produced beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) augments brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit epilepsy. The KD ameliorated pentetrazol-induced epilepsy in mice. Mechanistically, KD-produced BHB, but not other ketone bodies, inhibited HDAC1/HDAC2, increased H3K27 acetylation, and transcriptionally upregulated SIRT4 and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1). BHB-induced SIRT4 de-carbamylated and inactivated glutamate dehydrogenase to preserve glutamate for GABA synthesis, and GAD1 upregulation increased mouse brain GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit neuron excitation. BHB administration in mice inhibited epilepsy induced by pentetrazol. BHB-mediated relief of epilepsy required high GABA level and GABA/glutamate ratio. These results identified BHB as the major antiepileptic metabolite of the KD and suggested that BHB may serve as an alternative and less toxic antiepileptic agent than KD."
ENSG00000111640,GAPDH,0.4249719,weak,1,15883160,2005,Brain/CNS; NS,Ketone bodies stimulate chaperone-mediated autophagy.,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective lysosomal protein degradative process that is activated in higher organisms under conditions of prolonged starvation and in cell culture by the removal of serum. Ketone bodies are comprised of three compounds (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) that circulate during starvation, especially during prolonged starvation. Here we have investigated the hypothesis that ketone bodies induce CMA. We found that physiological concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum and without serum, however, acetoacetate only induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum. Lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells displayed an increased ability to degrade both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A, substrates for CMA. Isolated lysosomes from cells maintained in media without serum also demonstrated an increased ability to degrade glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A when the reaction was supplemented with BOH. Such treatment did not affect the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a or lysosomal heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa, two rate-limiting proteins in CMA. However, pretreatment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and ribonuclease A with BOH increased their rate of degradation by isolated lysosomes. Lysosomes pretreated with BOH showed no increase in proteolysis, suggesting that BOH acts on the substrates to increase their rates of proteolysis. Using OxyBlot analysis to detect carbonyl formation on proteins, one common marker of protein oxidation, we showed that treatment of substrates with BOH increased their oxidation. Neither glycerol, another compound that increases in circulation during prolonged starvation, nor butanol or butanone, compounds closely related to BOH, had an effect on CMA. The induction of CMA by ketone bodies may provide an important physiological mechanism for the activation of CMA during prolonged starvation."

The BOHB or AcAc was administered at concentrations of 10, 1, or 0.1 mM for 30 min at 4.0 ml/min. High-concentration infusions of BOHB and AcAc (10 mM) produced significant increases in insulin release in the presence of 4.4 mM glucose, but low-concentration infusions of BOHB and AcAc (1 and 0.1 mM) caused no significant changes in insulin secretion from perfused rat pancreas. BOHB (10, 1, and 0.1 mM) and AcAc (10 and 1 mM) infusion significantly inhibited glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas. These results suggest that physiological concentrations of ketone bodies have no direct effect on insulin release but have a direct inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas.;OBJECTIVE: The ketones d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate are elevated during prolonged fasting or during a ""ketogenic"" diet. Although weight loss on a ketogenic diet may be associated with decreased appetite and altered gut hormone levels, it is unknown whether such changes are caused by elevated blood ketones. This study investigated the effects of an exogenous ketone ester (KE) on appetite. METHODS: Following an overnight fast, subjects with normal weight (n = 15) consumed 1.9 kcal/kg of KE, or isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), in drinks matched for volume, taste, tonicity, and color. Blood samples were analyzed for BHB, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and a three-measure visual analogue scale was used to measure hunger, fullness, and desire to eat. RESULTS: KE consumption increased blood BHB levels from 0.2 to 3.3 mM after 60 minutes. DEXT consumption increased plasma glucose levels between 30 and 60 minutes. Postprandial plasma insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels were significantly lower 2 to 4 hours after KE consumption, compared with DEXT consumption. Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with consumption of DEXT. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood ketone levels may directly suppress appetite, as KE drinks lowered plasma ghrelin levels, perceived hunger, and desire to eat.;BACKGROUND: Exogenous ketones make it possible to reach a state of ketosis that may improve metabolic control in humans. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to determine whether the ingestion of a ketone monoester (KE) drink before a 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) would lower blood glucose concentrations. Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of KE on nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration and glucoregulatory hormones. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled crossover experiment in 15 individuals with obesity (mean +/- SD age: 47 +/- 10 y, BMI: 34 +/- 5 kg/m2). After an overnight fast, participants consumed a KE drink [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, 0.45 mL/kg body weight] or taste-matched control drink 30 min before completing a 75-g OGTT. Participants and study personnel performing laboratory analyses were blinded to each condition. RESULTS: The KE increased d-beta-hydroxybutyrate to a maximum of  approximately 3.4 mM (P < 0.001) during the OGTT. Compared with the control drink, KE reduced glucose (-11%, P = 0.002), NEFA (-21%, P = 0.009), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (-31%, P = 0.001) areas under the curve (AUCs), whereas glucagon AUC increased (+11%, P = 0.030). No differences in triglyceride, C-peptide, and insulin AUCs were observed after the KE drink. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased after the KE drink (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A KE drink consumed before an OGTT lowered glucose and NEFA AUCs with no increase in circulating insulin. Our results suggest that a single drink of KE may acutely improve metabolic control in individuals with obesity. Future research is warranted to examine whether KE could be used safely to have longer-term effects on metabolic control. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03461068.;OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the degree of ketosis, measured as plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) in fasting, was associated with changes in appetite feelings and plasma concentration of appetite-related hormones after weight loss. METHODS: A total of 87 individuals with obesity (BMI: 36.5 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2) , age: 42.4 +/- 9.7 years, 39 males) underwent 8 weeks of a very low-energy diet. Body weight/composition, plasma concentration of betaHB, and appetite-related hormones (active ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1], total peptide YY, cholecystokinin [CCK], and insulin) and subjective appetite feelings were measured at baseline and week 9. RESULTS: Participants lost 17.7 +/- 4.1 kg and were ketotic (betaHB: 1.24 +/- 0.82 mmol/L in fasting) at week 9. A negative association was found between betaHB in fasting at week 9 and changes in basal (r = -0.315, P = 0.003) and postprandial ghrelin concentration (r = -0.286, P = 0.008), and a positive association was found with the change in postprandial GLP-1 (r = 0.244, P = 0.025) and CCK (r = 0.228, P = 0.035). No association was seen between betaHB in fasting and changes in peptide YY or subjective feelings of appetite. CONCLUSIONS: betaHB plasma concentration in fasting is associated with lower concentrations of the hunger hormone ghrelin and increased concentrations of the satiety hormones GLP-1 and CCK. Future studies should explore the molecular mechanisms by which betaHB modulates the secretion of gut hormones.;Ketosis and exercise are both associated with alterations in perceived appetite and modification of appetite-regulating hormones. This study utilized a ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE) to examine the impact of elevated ketone body D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) during and after a bout of exercise on appetite-related hormones, appetite perception, and ad libitum energy intake over a 2 h post-exercise period. In a randomized crossover trial, 13 healthy males and females (age: 23.6 +/- 2.4 years, body mass index: 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg.m(-2)) completed an exercise session @ 70% VO(2peak) for 60 min on a cycling ergometer and consumed either: (1) Ketone monoester (KET) (0.5 g.kg(-1) pre-exercise + 0.25 g.kg(-1) post-exercise), or (2) isocaloric dextrose control (DEX). Transient ketonaemia was achieved with betaHB concentrations reaching 5.0 mM (range 4.1-6.1 mM) during the post-exercise period. Relative to the dextrose condition, acyl-ghrelin (P = 0.002) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (P = 0.038) were both reduced by acute ketosis immediately following exercise. AUC for acyl-ghrelin was lower in KET compared to DEX (P = 0.001), however there were no differences in AUC for GLP-1 (P = 0.221) or PYY (P = 0.654). Perceived appetite (hunger, P = 0.388, satisfaction, P = 0.082, prospective food consumption, P = 0.254, fullness, P = 0.282) and 2 h post-exercise ad libitum energy intake (P = 0.488) were not altered by exogenous ketosis. Although KE modifies homeostatic regulators of appetite, it does not appear that KE acutely alters energy intake during the post-exercise period in healthy adults.;Ingestion of nutrients stimulates incretin secretion from enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the epithelial layer of the gut. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is one of these incretins that stimulate postprandial insulin release and signal satiety to the brain. Understanding the regulation of incretin secretion might open up new therapeutic options for obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus. To investigate the inhibitory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion from EECs, in vitro cultures of murine GLUTag cells and differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers were stimulated with glucose to induce GLP-1 secretion. The effect of betaHB on GLP-1 secretion was studied using ELISA and ECLIA methods. GLUTag cells stimulated with glucose and betaHB were analysed using global proteomics focusing on cellular signalling pathways and the results were verified by Western blot. Results demonstrated betaHB had a significant inhibitory effect on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion at a dose of 100 mM in GLUTag cells. In differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers, glucose-induced secretion of GLP-1 was inhibited at a much lower dose of 10 mM betaHB. The addition of betaHB to GLUTag cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation of kinase AKT and transcription factor STAT3 and also influenced the expressions of signalling molecule IRS-2, kinase DGKepsilon and receptor FFAR3. In conclusion, betaHB displays an inhibitory effect on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion in vitro in GLUTag cells and in differentiated human jejunal enteroid monolayers. This effect may be mediated through multiple downstream mediators of G-protein coupled receptor activation, such as PI3K signalling.;Dietary carbohydrates raise blood glucose levels, and limiting carbohydrate intake improves glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Low carbohydrate intake (< 25 g) allows the body to utilize fat as its primary fuel. As a consequence of increased fatty acid oxidation, the liver produces ketones to serve as an alternative energy source. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) is the most abundant ketone. While betaHB has a wide range of functions outside of the pancreas, its direct effects on islet cell function remain understudied. We examined human islet secretory response to acute racemic betaHB treatment and observed increased insulin secretion at a low glucose concentration of 3 mM. Because betaHB is a chiral molecule, existing as both R and S forms, we further studied insulin and glucagon secretion following acute treatment with individual betaHB enantiomers in human and C57BL/6J mouse islets. We found that acute treatment with R-betaHB increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion at physiological glucose concentrations in both human and mouse islets. Proteomic analysis of human islets treated with R-betaHB over 72 hours showed altered abundance of proteins that may promote islet cell health and survival. Collectively, our data show that physiological concentrations of betaHB influence hormone secretion and signaling within pancreatic islets."

It remains to be investigated whether growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15)-an anorexigenic hormone-is involved in this process. The aim was to investigate the effect of a ketone ester beverage delivering beta-hydroxybutyrate (KEbetaHB) on plasma levels of GDF-15, as well as assess the influence of eating behaviour on it. The study was a randomised controlled trial (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03889210). Individuals were given a KEbetaHB beverage or placebo in a cross-over fashion. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min after ingestion. Eating behaviour was assessed using the three-factor eating questionnaire. GDF-15 levels were not significantly different (p = 0.503) after the KEbetaHB beverage compared with the placebo. This finding remained consistent across the cognitive restraint, emotional eating, and uncontrolled eating domains. Changes in the anorexigenic hormone GDF-15, irrespective of eating behaviour, do not appear to play a major role in the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketones."

We have previously shown that the overactivation of the Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptor type, through the continuous infusion of AMPA in the lumbar spinal cord of adult rats during several days, results in progressive rear limb paralysis and bilateral MN degeneration. Because it has been shown that energy failure and oxidative stress are involved in MN degeneration, in both ALS and experimental models of spinal MN degeneration, including excitotoxicity, in this work we tested the protective effect of the energy substrates pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) and the antioxidants glutathione ethyl ester (GEE) and ascorbate in this chronic AMPA-induced neurodegeneration. RESULTS: AMPA infusion induced remarkable progressive motor deficits, assessed by two motor tasks, that by day seven reach bilateral rear limb paralysis. These effects correlate with the death of >80% of lumbar spinal MNs in the infused and the neighbor spinal cord segments, as well as with notable astrogliosis in the ventral horns, detected by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry. Co-infusion with pyruvate or betaHB notably prevented the motor deficits and paralysis, decreased MN loss to <25% and completely prevented the induction of astrogliosis. In contrast, the antioxidants tested were ineffective regarding all parameters analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic progressive excitotoxicity due to AMPA receptors overactivation results in MN death and astrogliosis, with consequent motor deficits and paralysis. Because of the notable protection against these effects exerted by pyruvate and betaHB, which are well established mitochondrial energy substrates, we conclude that deficits in mitochondrial energy metabolism are an important factor in the mechanisms of this slowly developed excitotoxic MN death, while the lack of protective effect of the antioxidants indicates that oxidative stress seems to be less significant factor. Because excitotoxicity may be involved in MN degeneration in ALS, these findings suggest possible preventive or therapeutic strategies for the disease.;The aim of the present study was to explore the potential anticonvulsant effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in a kainic acid (KA)-induced rat epilepsy model. The KA-induced rat seizure model was established and BHB was administrated intraperitoneally at a dose of 4 mmol/kg 30 min prior to KA injection. Hippocampal tissues were then obtained 1, 3 and 7 days following KA administration, following which the expression levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured using a double immunofluorescence labeling method. In addition, the contents of glutathione (GSH), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ATP were measured using ELISA. Pretreatment with BHB markedly increased the expression of NSE after KA injection compared with that in the normal saline (NS) + KA group, suggesting that the application of BHB could alleviate neuronal damage in rats. The protective effect of BHB may be associated with suppressed inflammatory responses, which was indicated by the observed inhibition of GFAP expression in rats in the BHB + KA group compared with that in the NS + KA group. It was also found that GSH and GABA contents were notably increased after the rats were pretreated with BHB compared with those in the NS + KA group. To conclude, the application of exogenous BHB can serve as a novel therapeutic agent for epilepsy.;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).;The consequences of stroke include cognitive deficits and sensorimotor disturbances, which are largely related to mitochondrial impairments in the brain. In this work, we have shown that the mimetic of the ketogenic diet beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) can improve neurological brain function in stroke. At 3 weeks after photothrombotic stroke, mice receiving betaHB with drinking water before and after surgery recovered faster in terms of sensorimotor functions assessed by the string test and static rods and cognitive functions assessed by the Morris water maze. At the same time, the betaHB-treated mice had lower expression of some markers of astrocyte activation and inflammation (Gfap, Il-1b, Tnf). We hypothesize that long-term administration of betaHB promotes the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway, which leads to increased expression of antioxidant genes targeting mitochondria and genes involved in signaling pathways necessary for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity. betaHB partially maintained mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity during the first days after photothrombosis. However, in the following three weeks, the number of mtDNA damages increased in all experimental groups, which coincided with a decrease in Ogg1 expression, which plays an important role in mtDNA repair. Thus, we can assume that betaHB is not only an important metabolite that provides additional energy to brain tissue during recovery from stroke under conditions of mitochondrial damage but also an important signaling molecule that supports neuronal plasticity and reduces neuroinflammation.;AIMS: Cerebral complications after cardiac arrest (CA) remain a major problem worldwide. The aim was to test the effects of sodium-ss-hydroxybutyrate (SBHB) infusion on brain injury in a clinically relevant swine model of CA. RESULTS: CA was electrically induced in 20 adult swine. After 10 min, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 5 min. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the animals were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of balanced crystalloid (controls, n = 11) or SBHB (theoretical osmolarity 1189 mOsm/l, n = 8) for 12 h. Multimodal neurological and cardiovascular monitoring were implemented in all animals. Nineteen of the 20 animals achieved ROSC. Blood sodium concentrations, osmolarity and circulating KBs were higher in the treated animals than in the controls. SBHB infusion was associated with significantly lower plasma biomarkers of brain injury at 6 (glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP and neuron specific enolase, NSE) and 12 h (neurofilament light chain, NFL, GFAP and NSE) compared to controls. The amplitude of the stereoelectroencephalograph (sEEG) increased in treated animals after ROSC compared to controls. Cerebral glucose uptake was lower in treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental model, SBHB infusion after resuscitated CA was associated with reduced circulating markers of cerebral injury and increased sEEG amplitude."
ENSG00000259384,GH1,0.41574955,weak,1,6348066,1983,Brain/CNS; NS,Influence of ketone body infusion on plasma growth hormone and glucagon in man.,"The influence of ketone body infusion on the serum GH and glucagon response to FFA depression and insulin hypoglycemia was investigated in 10 healthy men. Intravenous infusion of nicotinic acid induced suppression of both FFA and ketone bodies. This was accompanied by a delayed GH increase to 21.1 +/- 6.9 ng/ml (at 300 min). During an additional beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) infusion, FFA remained depressed, but ketone bodies were elevated, and the GH response was abolished (maximum 5.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ml). During infusion of OHB alone, FFA were suppressed. GH increased significantly, although less markedly than during suppression of both FFA and ketone bodies (to 9.3 +/- 3.1 ng/ml at 270 min). No GH rise occurred when both FFA and ketone bodies were kept elevated by the addition of a lipid infusion. The GH rise in response to insulin hypoglycemia was not changed by an OHB infusion (43.2 +/- 4.6 vs. 48.0 +/- 7.3 ng/ml). However, OHB increased the net GH output by significantly delaying the return to basal concentrations in the presence of a reduced FFA rebound. An effect of OHB infusion on the plasma glucagon concentration during all experiments was small, and its physiological significance is doubtful. These results confirm that FFA depression induces delayed GH secretion. They suggest that this is not wholly dependent on concomitant depression of ketone bodies. On the other hand, when ketone bodies are elevated, the GH response to FFA depression is diminished or absent. The net GH response to changes in lipid substrates probably depends on the concentration of both FFA and ketone bodies."

Although weight loss on a ketogenic diet may be associated with decreased appetite and altered gut hormone levels, it is unknown whether such changes are caused by elevated blood ketones. This study investigated the effects of an exogenous ketone ester (KE) on appetite. METHODS: Following an overnight fast, subjects with normal weight (n = 15) consumed 1.9 kcal/kg of KE, or isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), in drinks matched for volume, taste, tonicity, and color. Blood samples were analyzed for BHB, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and a three-measure visual analogue scale was used to measure hunger, fullness, and desire to eat. RESULTS: KE consumption increased blood BHB levels from 0.2 to 3.3 mM after 60 minutes. DEXT consumption increased plasma glucose levels between 30 and 60 minutes. Postprandial plasma insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels were significantly lower 2 to 4 hours after KE consumption, compared with DEXT consumption. Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with consumption of DEXT. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood ketone levels may directly suppress appetite, as KE drinks lowered plasma ghrelin levels, perceived hunger, and desire to eat.;OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the degree of ketosis, measured as plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) in fasting, was associated with changes in appetite feelings and plasma concentration of appetite-related hormones after weight loss. METHODS: A total of 87 individuals with obesity (BMI: 36.5 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2) , age: 42.4 +/- 9.7 years, 39 males) underwent 8 weeks of a very low-energy diet. Body weight/composition, plasma concentration of betaHB, and appetite-related hormones (active ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1], total peptide YY, cholecystokinin [CCK], and insulin) and subjective appetite feelings were measured at baseline and week 9. RESULTS: Participants lost 17.7 +/- 4.1 kg and were ketotic (betaHB: 1.24 +/- 0.82 mmol/L in fasting) at week 9. A negative association was found between betaHB in fasting at week 9 and changes in basal (r = -0.315, P = 0.003) and postprandial ghrelin concentration (r = -0.286, P = 0.008), and a positive association was found with the change in postprandial GLP-1 (r = 0.244, P = 0.025) and CCK (r = 0.228, P = 0.035). No association was seen between betaHB in fasting and changes in peptide YY or subjective feelings of appetite. CONCLUSIONS: betaHB plasma concentration in fasting is associated with lower concentrations of the hunger hormone ghrelin and increased concentrations of the satiety hormones GLP-1 and CCK. Future studies should explore the molecular mechanisms by which betaHB modulates the secretion of gut hormones.;Ketosis and exercise are both associated with alterations in perceived appetite and modification of appetite-regulating hormones. This study utilized a ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE) to examine the impact of elevated ketone body D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) during and after a bout of exercise on appetite-related hormones, appetite perception, and ad libitum energy intake over a 2 h post-exercise period. In a randomized crossover trial, 13 healthy males and females (age: 23.6 +/- 2.4 years, body mass index: 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg.m(-2)) completed an exercise session @ 70% VO(2peak) for 60 min on a cycling ergometer and consumed either: (1) Ketone monoester (KET) (0.5 g.kg(-1) pre-exercise + 0.25 g.kg(-1) post-exercise), or (2) isocaloric dextrose control (DEX). Transient ketonaemia was achieved with betaHB concentrations reaching 5.0 mM (range 4.1-6.1 mM) during the post-exercise period. Relative to the dextrose condition, acyl-ghrelin (P = 0.002) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (P = 0.038) were both reduced by acute ketosis immediately following exercise. AUC for acyl-ghrelin was lower in KET compared to DEX (P = 0.001), however there were no differences in AUC for GLP-1 (P = 0.221) or PYY (P = 0.654). Perceived appetite (hunger, P = 0.388, satisfaction, P = 0.082, prospective food consumption, P = 0.254, fullness, P = 0.282) and 2 h post-exercise ad libitum energy intake (P = 0.488) were not altered by exogenous ketosis. Although KE modifies homeostatic regulators of appetite, it does not appear that KE acutely alters energy intake during the post-exercise period in healthy adults.;AIM: To investigate the acute effect of ketone ester (KE) ingestion on appetite and plasma concentrations of acyl ghrelin (AG), unacylated ghrelin (UAG) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, and to compare responses with those elicited by isocaloric glucose (GLU) administration. METHODS: We examined 10 healthy young men on three separate occasions using a placebo (PBO)-controlled crossover design. A KE versus taste-matched isovolumetric and isocaloric 50% GLU and taste-matched isovolumetric PBO vehicle was orally administered. Our main outcome measures were plasma concentrations of AG, UAG, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 along with appetite sensation scores assessed by visual analogue scale. RESULTS: KE ingestion resulted in an average peak beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 5.5 mM. AG and UAG were lowered by approximately 25% following both KE and GLU intake compared with PBO. In the case of AG, the differences were -52.1 (-79.4, -24.8) for KE and -48.4 (-75.4, -21.5) pg/mL for GLU intake (P < .01). Concentrations of AG remained lower with KE but returned to baseline and were comparable with PBO levels after GLU intake. GLP-1, GIP, gastrin and cholecystokinin were not affected by KE ingestion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the suppressive effects on appetite sensation scores associated with hyperketonaemia are more probable to be mediated through reduced ghrelin concentrations than by increased activity of cholecystokinin, gastrin, GIP or GLP-1.;SCOPE: The main aim of the present study is to study the effect of acute ketosis on parameters of appetite regulation in prediabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a randomized controlled trial registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03889210. After an overnight fast, 18 adults with prediabetes are assigned to consume a ketone monoester (d-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol) drink and a placebo drink in cross-over fashion. Blood samples are collected every 30 min, from baseline to 150 min. Paired t test is used to compare the total area under the curve (AUC) for the changes in parameters of appetite regulation (acylated ghrelin, peptide YY [PYY], and hunger) following both drinks. Significant elevation in blood beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.2 to 3.5 mmol L(-1) (p < 0.001) is achieved within 30 min. Acute ketosis does not result in statistically significant differences in the AUCs for ghrelin, PYY, and hunger. CONCLUSION: Acute ketosis consistently does not affect both objective and subjective parameters of appetite regulation in prediabetes."

We assessed the metabolism of the ketone tracer, carbon-11 acetoacetate ((11)C-AcAc), by the left and right ventricles of the heart and by the kidney using positron emission tomography (PET) in n = 10 healthy adults under four experimental conditions: a 4-h fast (fasted) +/- a single 12 g oral dose of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), and a single complete, liquid replacement meal (hereafter referred to as the ""fed"" condition) +/- a single 12 g oral dose of D-BHB. Under these experimental conditions, the kinetics of (11)C-AcAc metabolism fitted a two-compartment model in the heart and a three-compartment model in the kidney. Plasma ketones were about 10-fold higher with the oral dose of D-BHB. During the four conditions, tracer kinetics were broadly similar in the myocardium and kidney cortex. (11)C-AcAc metabolism by the kidney pelvis was similar in three of the four study conditions but, later, peaked significantly higher than that in the cortex, the exception was that the tracer uptake was significantly lower in the fed condition without D-BHB. (11)C-AcAc uptake was significantly inversely correlated with age in the kidney cortex, and its oxidative metabolism was significantly positively correlated with age in the left ventricle. D-BHB blunted the insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and C-peptide response to the meal. This PET methodology and these acute metabolic perturbations would be suitable for future studies assessing cardiorenal ketone metabolism in conditions in which heart and kidney functions are experimentally modified or compromised by disease."

Recent studies show success in preclinical models treating these disorders with an interventional ketogenic diet. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a ketogenic diet modifies pathological MGO signaling as a mechanism underlying neuropathy improvement. We found that mice injected with MGO displayed nocifensive behaviors, whereas mice prefed a ketogenic diet were resistant to mechanical allodynia elicited by MGO. In addition, levels of circulating MGO were reduced in ketogenic diet-fed mice and negatively correlated with levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB). Methylglyoxal is normally scavenged by the glyoxalase system, and ketogenic diet-fed mice displayed increased glyoxalase 1 activity compared with chow-fed control mice. Recent studies also suggest that ketone bodies contribute to MGO detoxification, consistent with a negative correlation between beta-HB and MGO. To assess whether ketone bodies modified MGO-evoked nociception through direct MGO detoxification, we coincubated either acetoacetate or beta-HB with MGO before injection. Mice receiving intraplantar MGO injection exhibit increased nociceptive behavior (lifting, licking, biting, and scratching), which was significantly reduced by coincubation with either acetoacetate or beta-HB. Methylglyoxal increased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-positive cells in the spinal dorsal horn, and this evoked spinal activation was ameliorated by preincubation with acetoacetate or beta-HB. These results suggest that a ketogenic diet and ketone bodies ameliorate MGO-evoked nociception, partially through detoxification of MGO, and provide rationale for therapeutic intervention with a ketogenic diet in MGO-driven pathologies."
ENSG00000115419,GLS,0.45176694,weak,1,34798244,2022,,Acute Echocardiographic Effects of Exogenous Ketone Administration in Healthy Participants.,"BACKGROUND: Interest in therapeutic applications of exogenous ketones has grown significantly, spanning patients with heart failure to endurance athletes. Exogenous ketones engender significant effects on cardiac function in heart failure and provide an ergogenic benefit in athletes. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exogenous ketones on cardiac function in healthy participants. METHODS: In a single-arm intervention study, 20 fasting, healthy participants underwent comprehensive echocardiography (two-dimensional, Doppler, and strain) before and 30 min after weight-based oral ketone ester administration. The relationship between changes in log-transformed biomarker levels and change in absolute global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: The mean age was 30 +/- 7 years, 50% were women, 45% were nonwhite, and the average body mass index was 24.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2). Ketone ingestion acutely elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels from a median of 0.13 mmol/L (interquartile range, 0.10-0.37 mmol/L) to 3.23 mmol/L (interquartile range, 2.40-4.97 mmol/L) (P < .001). After ketone ester consumption, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biventricular function, left ventricular GLS, and left atrial (LA) strain all augmented, while systemic vascular resistance decreased. Displayed as mean change, increases in ejection fraction (3.1%, 95% CI, 2.0%-4.2%, P < .001), GLS (2.0%, 95% CI, 1.4%-2.7%, P < .001), right ventricular S' (1.1 cm/sec, 95% CI, 0.4-1.8 cm/sec, P = .004), LA reservoir strain (7%, 95% CI, 3%-12%, P = .005), and LA contractile strain (4%, 2%-6%, P = .001) were observed. During robustly achieved ketosis, change in GLS was inversely associated with change in nonesterified fatty acids (P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: In a single-arm study, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biventricular function, and LV and LA strain acutely augmented after ketone ester ingestion in healthy, fasting participants, similar to several effects observed in the failing heart. These data may provide supporting data for the ergogenic benefits observed in athletes and may become increasingly relevant with exogenous ketone consumption across a variety of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular applications."

Glucose production also decreases by 20 to 30%. Glutamate release in the incubation medium is significantly augmented by fatty acids or ketones. When glutamate 5 mM is used as substrate instead of glutamine, glutamate uptake, ammoniagenesis and glucose production are significantly depressed by fatty acids and ketones. Increased glutamate release from glutamine, decreased glutamate uptake and decreased gluconeogenesis from glutamine or glutamate provide evidence that ketone bodies and fatty acids depress the net flux through the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction invovled in glutamine metabolism. This is further supported by the fact that addition of ketones to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia stimulates net glutamate synthesis by kidney tubules.;To investigate the mechanisms of the antiammoniagenic effect of ketone bodies, acidotic dogs (NH4Cl) were infused with either beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate. Total blood ketones ranged from 2 to 4 mM. Renal ammoniagenesis fell by a mean of 53%, with a proportional decrease in glutamine extraction. Glutamate release in the renal vein rose, renal extraction of lactate fell, and aspartate and alanine production decreased. Study of the metabolite profile of the renal cortex by the freeze-clamp technique before and after ketone infusion showed that tissue glutamine concentration was unchanged, whereas glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, and citrate rose. The intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway, such as phosphoenolypyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and glucose-6-phosphate, fell significantly. The redox state as calculated from the free NAD+/NADH ratios in the cytosolic (lactate dehydrogenase) and the mitochondrial (glutamate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) compartments was reduced. The present study suggests that ketone bodies inhibit renal ammoniagenesis through increased generation of alpha-ketoglutarate (metabolic or bicarbonate effect) and a decrease in the mitochondrial and cytosolic redox potentials in the kidney.;Ketone bodies can be increased in the blood under certain physiological conditions, but their role under such conditions remains to be clarified. In the present study, we found the increment and usage of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during acute stress. BHB levels increased in the blood and PFC after 30-min acute immobilization stress, and BHB dehydrogenase 1 increased in the PFC simultaneously, but not in the hippocampus. Moreover, increased levels of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate carboxylase, and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 were found in the PFC, implicating the metabolism of increased BHB in the brain. Thus, we checked the levels of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA and found increased levels of glutamate and glutamine in the stressed group compared with that in the control group in the PFC. Exogenous administration of BHB enhanced struggling behaviors under stressful conditions. Our results suggest that the metabolism of BHB from peripheral blood in the PFC may contribute to acute stress responses to escape stressful conditions.;Ketogenic diet (KD) alleviates refractory epilepsy and reduces seizures in children. However, the metabolic/cell biologic mechanisms by which the KD exerts its antiepileptic efficacy remain elusive. Herein, we report that KD-produced beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) augments brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit epilepsy. The KD ameliorated pentetrazol-induced epilepsy in mice. Mechanistically, KD-produced BHB, but not other ketone bodies, inhibited HDAC1/HDAC2, increased H3K27 acetylation, and transcriptionally upregulated SIRT4 and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1). BHB-induced SIRT4 de-carbamylated and inactivated glutamate dehydrogenase to preserve glutamate for GABA synthesis, and GAD1 upregulation increased mouse brain GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit neuron excitation. BHB administration in mice inhibited epilepsy induced by pentetrazol. BHB-mediated relief of epilepsy required high GABA level and GABA/glutamate ratio. These results identified BHB as the major antiepileptic metabolite of the KD and suggested that BHB may serve as an alternative and less toxic antiepileptic agent than KD."

In the present study we investigated the role of AcAc and BHB at concentrations found in diabetic patients during ketoacidotic crises and in individuals affected by succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiencies, disorders clinically characterized by neurological symptoms, on a large number of oxidative stress parameters in fresh cerebral cortex of developing rats. Lipid peroxidation (chemiluminescence and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels), protein oxidative damage (carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl oxidation), 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate oxidation and the non-enzymatic (total antioxidant reactivity and glutathione levels) and enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) antioxidant defenses were not changed by doses of BHB and AcAc as high as 25 mM in cortical supernatants under basal conditions. Furthermore, BHB did not affect the increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels provoked by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acids and by a hydroxyl-induced generation system. Finally, BHB and AcAc were not able to oxidize sulfhydryl groups from a commercial GSH solution. Therefore, under basal conditions or under situations with high production of free radicals, AcAc and BHB were not able to reduce or increase the oxidative stress parameters in the brain. Taken together, our present results do not support the hypothesis that BHB and AcAc act as potent direct or indirect pro-oxidants or antioxidants in the CNS.;One of the therapeutic approaches to age-related diseases is modulation of body cell metabolism through certain diets or their pharmacological mimetics. The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

However, existing therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus have limited success on the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate elevation in D-beta-hydroxybutyrate improves cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Type 2 diabetic (db/db) and their corresponding wild-type mice were fed a control diet or a diet where carbohydrates were equicalorically replaced by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (ketone ester [KE]). After 4 weeks, echocardiography demonstrated that a KE diet improved systolic and diastolic function in db/db mice. A KE diet increased expression of mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase and restored decreased expression of mitochondrial beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, key enzymes in cardiac ketone metabolism. A KE diet significantly enhanced both basal and ADP-mediated oxygen consumption in cardiac mitochondria from both wild-type and db/db animals, however, it did not result in the increased mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Additionally, db/db mice on a KE diet had increased resistance to oxidative and redox stress, with evidence of restoration of decreased expression of thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidase 4 and less permeability transition pore activity in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy were significantly increased in cardiomyocytes from db/db mice on a KE diet. The increase in mitophagy was correlated with restoration of mitofusin 2 expression, which contributed to improved coupling between cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase translocation into mitochondria and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-mediated autophagosome formation. Conclusions Moderate elevation in circulating D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels via KE supplementation enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and oxygen consumption and increases resistance to oxidative/redox stress and mPTP opening, thus resulting in improvement of cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

However, the role of beta-HB in the regulation of neurological injury after cardiac arrest (CA) remains unclear. We investigated the effect of beta-HB on brain mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological function after CA. A rat model of CA was established by asphyxia. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, control group, and beta-HB group. Animals received 200 mg/kg beta-HB or same volume vehicle at 10 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation by intraperitoneal injection. Neurological function was evaluated by neurologic deficit score and Y-maze. Neuronal cell loss and apoptosis were detected through hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Oxidative stress levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining of 4-hydoxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure of brain cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the protein expression levels of Bak, caspase 3, gasdermin D, caspase 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and phospho-Drp1 (ser616) were measured. We found that neurological function and survival rate were significantly higher in the beta-HB group compared with the control group. beta-HB also reduced neurons death and neurological oxidative stress after CA. Moreover, beta-HB reduced neurological injury from apoptosis and pyroptosis after CA. In addition, beta-HB maintained the structural integrity of brain mitochondria, prevented mitochondrial fission, and increased brain energy metabolism after CA. In conclusion, beta-HB beneficially affected the neurological function of rats after global cerebral ischemia, associated with decreased mitochondrial fission, and improved mitochondrial function. Our results suggest that beta-HB might benefit patients suffering from neurological dysfunction after CA.;BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms, and affects millions of people worldwide. Growing evidence implies beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the ketone bodies generated by ketogenesis, plays a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to verify the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB on PD and further explore potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We performed the experiments on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice model in vivo and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-simulated BV2 cell model in vitro, with or without BHB pretreatment. Motor function was assessed by pole test, forced swimming test, traction test and open field test. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in MPTP-induced PD model mice. The expression of the STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway was measured by western blots. Proinflammatory cytokines was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: BHB treatment reversed motor deficits, loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in PD mice induced by MPTP. Moreover, BHB inhibited microglia pyroptosis by negatively regulating STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway, resulting in downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18) in vivo and vitro. CONCLUSION: These data suggested BHB supplement inhibited pyroptosis by down-regulating STAT3-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation for PD models in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provided novel insights and available interventions for the prevention and treatment of PD, and highlighted pyroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for PD.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for the majority of cases, is sturdily influenced by lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, obesity, and diabetes, leading to its classification as Type 3 diabetes. To model this pathological link, our AD-like model was developed by feeding Wistar male rats a high-fat diet with fructose in drinking water (HFFD) for 8 weeks, followed by a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This group was compared with a normal control group fed a standard diet and a beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-treated group (125 mg/kg, p.o.), administered starting 3 h after LPS and continuing for 1 week. The results demonstrate that BHB treatment illuminated cognitive gains, as indicated by the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1beta/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function."

Furthermore, glucose replenishment following hypoglycemic coma induces neuronal cell death. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity and the protective effect of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) using SH-SY5Y cells. The cytotoxic mechanism of metformin under glucose deficiency was also examined. Cell viability under 1 mM glucose (glucose deficiency) was significantly decreased which was accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3beta). ROS inhibitor reversed the glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity and restored the reduced phosphorylation of ERK and GSK3beta. While metformin did not alter cell viability in normal glucose media, it further increased cell death and ROS production under glucose deficiency. However, D-BHB reversed cytotoxicity, ROS production, and the decrease in phosphorylation of ERK and GSK3beta induced by the glucose deficiency. ERK inhibitor reversed the D-BHB-induced increase in cell viability under glucose deficiency, whereas GSK3beta inhibitor did not restore glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity. Finally, the protective effect of D-BHB against glucose deficiency was confirmed in primary neuronal cells. We demonstrate that glucose deficiency-induced cytotoxicity is mediated by ERK inhibition through ROS production, which is attenuated by D-BHB and intensified by metformin.;Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes and is clinically featured by progressive albuminuria, consequent to glomerular destruction that involves podocyte senescence. Burgeoning evidence suggests that ketosis, in particular beta-hydroxybutyrate, exerts a beneficial effect on aging and on myriad metabolic or chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. Its effect on DKD is largely unknown. In vitro in podocytes exposed to a diabetic milieu, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment substantially mitigated cellular senescence and injury, as evidenced by reduced formation of gammaH2AX foci, reduced staining for senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity, diminished expression of key mediators of senescence signaling like p16(INK4A) and p21, and preserved expression of synaptopodin. This beneficial action of beta-hydroxybutyrate coincided with a reinforced transcription factor Nrf2 antioxidant response. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a convergent point for myriad signaling pathways regulating Nrf2 activity, seems to contribute. Indeed, trigonelline, a selective inhibitor of Nrf2, or ectopic expression of constitutively active mutant GSK3beta abolished, whereas selective activation of Nrf2 was sufficient for the anti-senescent and podocyte protective effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Moreover, molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate is able to directly target the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3beta and thereby block its kinase activity. In murine models of streptozotocin-elicited DKD, beta-hydroxybutyrate therapy inhibited GSK3beta and reinforced Nrf2 activation in glomerular podocytes, resulting in lessened podocyte senescence and injury and improved diabetic glomerulopathy and albuminuria. Thus, our findings may pave the way for developing a beta-hydroxybutyrate-based novel approach of therapeutic ketosis for treating DKD.;BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective role of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: A two-hit model with a high-fat diet (HFD) and N(omega)-nitrol-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was used as an HFpEF model. The treatment group received a weekly intraperitoneal injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Cardiac function, inflammation, and fibrosis were evaluated. CD3(+)CD4(+)Foxp3(+) positive cells within the myocardium were quantified by flow cytometry. The NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) pathway was examined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: BHB improved diastolic function, fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in HFpEF. Additionally, BHB inhibited cardiac inflammation and increased cardiac Treg cells, which could be due to the downregulation of the NOX2/GSK-3beta pathway. CONCLUSION: BHB protected against the progression of HFpEF by increasing cardiac Treg cells by modulating the NOX2/GSK-3beta pathway.;OBJECTIVE: Ketogenic diets (KD) have been shown to alleviate insulin resistance (IR) by exerting anti-lipogenic and insulin sensitizing effects in the liver through a variety of pathways. The present study sought to investigate whether a ketogenic diet also improves insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle cells through alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. METHODS: High-fat diet-induced IR mice were allowed to a 2-week ketogenic diet. Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were evaluated through GTT, ITT, and HOMA-IR. The C2C12 myoblasts exposed to palmitic acid were used to evaluate the insulin sensitization effects of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB). Molecular mechanisms concerning ER stress signaling activation and glucose uptake were assessed. RESULTS: The AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited, ER stress signaling associated with IRE1, PERK, and BIP was activated, and the number of Glut4 proteins translocated to membrane decreased in the muscle of HFD mice. However, all these changes were reversed after 2 weeks of feeding on a ketogenic diet. Consistently in C2C12 myoblasts, the AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, IRE1, and BIP were increased, and the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane decreased. However, beta-OHB treatment alleviated ER stress and improved the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that KD ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, which was partially mediated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. The insulin sensitization effect of beta-OHB is associated with up regulation of AKT/GSK3beta pathway and the increase in the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane."

Unexpectedly, insulin increased cardiac hydraulic work but decreased net glycolytic flux and O2 consumption, improving net cardiac efficiency by 28%. These improvements in physiologic performance and metabolic efficiency resulted from reduction of the mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] and oxidation of mitochondrial [coenzyme Q]/[coenzyme QH2], increasing the energy of the proton gradient between cytosolic and mitochondrial phases and leading to a doubling of the cytosolic free [sigmaATP]/[sigmaADP][sigmaPi]. The acute metabolic effects of insulin were qualitatively duplicated by addition of a ratio of 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and 1 mM acetoacetate, and the increase in the efficiency was the same as with addition of insulin. Addition of both insulin and ketones to the glucose perfusate increased the efficiency of cardiac hydraulic work by 35%. The ability of a physiologic ratio of ketone bodies to correct most of the metabolic defects of acute insulin deficiency suggests therapeutic roles for these natural substrates during periods of impaired cardiac performance and in insulin-resistant states."

Objective: The objective was to investigate the effect of acute exogenous ketone monoester (beta-hydroxybutyrate) on plasma levels of markers of iron metabolism in people with prediabetes. Methods: Eighteen participants with new-onset prediabetes after acute pancreatitis aged 18 years or above took part in randomised controlled cross-over trial in Auckland, New Zealand. After an overnight fast, participants consumed the exogenous ketone supplement or placebo. Blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0 minutes) and then serially every 30 minutes for 150 minutes. Both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention/placebo allocation. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed using total area under the curve to determine the change in hepcidin and ferritin over time after consumption of the exogenous ketone supplement and placebo. Results: Consumption of the exogenous ketone supplement significantly elevated blood levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.20 mmol L(-1) at baseline to 3.50 mmol L(-1) at 30 minutes (p < 0.05) and remained significantly elevated for the duration of the trial. The total area under the curve of hepcidin was 340.5 +/- 121.1 ng mL(-1) after the exogenous ketone supplementation as compared with 343.2 +/- 119.6 ng mL(-1) min(-1) after the use of placebo (p = 0.91). The total area under the curve of ferritin was 786.7 +/- 129.1 ng mL(-1) min(-1) after the exogenous ketone supplementation as compared with 776.9 +/- 131.4 ng mL(-1) min(-1) after the use of placebo (p = 0.10). Conclusion: Acute supplementation of beta-hydroxybutyrate did not significantly affect the circulating levels of hepcidin or ferritin in people with prediabetes. Long-term effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate warrant investigations in the future."

Here we show in a stroke model that the hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2, GPR109A) is required for the neuroprotective effect of BHB and a ketogenic diet, as this effect is lost in Hca2(-/-) mice. We further demonstrate that nicotinic acid, a clinically used HCA2 agonist, reduces infarct size via a HCA2-mediated mechanism, and that noninflammatory Ly-6C(Lo) monocytes and/or macrophages infiltrating the ischemic brain also express HCA2. Using cell ablation and chimeric mice, we demonstrate that HCA2 on monocytes and/or macrophages is required for the protective effect of nicotinic acid. The activation of HCA2 induces a neuroprotective phenotype of monocytes and/or macrophages that depends on PGD2 production by COX1 and the haematopoietic PGD2 synthase. Our data suggest that HCA2 activation by dietary or pharmacological means instructs Ly-6C(Lo) monocytes and/or macrophages to deliver a neuroprotective signal to the brain.;BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sterile inflammation resulting in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs unpredictably after many years of excess alcohol intake. The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease. METHODS: We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection. RESULTS: Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) induced by BHB. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. LAY SUMMARY: Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and beta-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.;A ketogenic diet (KD, high-fat, low-carbohydrate) can benefit refractory epilepsy, but underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used mice inducibly expressing a mutated form of the mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme UNG1 (mutUNG1) to cause progressive mitochondrial dysfunction selectively in forebrain neurons. We examined the levels of mRNAs and proteins crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. We show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons in mutUNG1 mice, as well as cultured rat hippocampal neurons and human fibroblasts with H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress, improve markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function when fed on a KD, and when exposed to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, by upregulating PGC1alpha, SIRT3 and UCP2, and (in cultured cells) increasing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The mitochondrial level of UCP2 was significantly higher in the perikarya and axon terminals of hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in KD treated mutUNG1 mice compared with mutUNG1 mice fed a standard diet. The beta-hydroxybutyrate receptor GPR109a (HCAR2), but not the structurally closely related lactate receptor GPR81 (HCAR1), was upregulated in mutUNG1 mice on a KD, suggesting a selective influence of KD on ketone body receptor mechanisms. We conclude that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in mutUNG1 expressing mice causes oxidative stress, and that exposure of animals to KD, or of cells to ketone body in vitro, elicits compensatory mechanisms acting to augment mitochondrial mass and bioenergetics via the PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 axis (The compensatory processes are overwhelmed in the mutUNG1 mice by all the newly formed mitochondria being dysfunctional).;The mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain are poorly understood. Here we show the unexplored role of the hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor type 2 (HCAR2) in 2 models of neuropathic pain. We used an oral treatment with dimethyl fumarate and the HCAR2 endogenous ligand beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in wild-type (WT) and HCAR2-null mice. We found an up-regulation of the HCAR2 in the sciatic nerve and the dorsal root ganglia in neuropathic mice. Accordingly, acute and chronic treatment with dimethylfumarate (DMF) and BHB reduced the tactile allodynia. This effect was completely lost in the HCAR2-null mice after a 2-d starvation protocol, in which the BHB reached the concentration able to activate the HCAR2-reduced tactile allodynia in female WT mice, but not in the HCAR2-null mice. Finally, we showed that chronic treatment with DMF reduced the firing of the ON cells (cells responding with an excitation after noxious stimulation) of the rostral ventromedial medulla. Our results pave the way for investigating the mechanisms by which HCAR2 regulates neuropathic pain plasticity.-Boccella, S., Guida, F., De Logu, F., De Gregorio, D., Mazzitelli, M., Belardo, C., Iannotta, M., Serra, N., Nassini, R., de Novellis, V., Geppetti, P., Maione, S., Luongo, L. Ketones and pain: unexplored role of hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor type 2 in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.;Post-sepsis cognitive impairment is one of the major sequelae in sepsis survivors. Its prevention remains clinically challenging. Here we tested the effects and underlying mechanisms of exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on post-sepsis cognitive impairment. We found that subcutaneous administration of BHB increased survival and body weight recovery of sepsis mice and improved learning and memory of sepsis surviving mice in a cecal ligation and perforation-induced sepsis model. Additionally, the improvement of learning and memory of sepsis surviving mice was still detected even if BHB was administrated at the late stage of sepsis. In contrast, glucose solution did not show similar effects. Mechanistically, subcutaneous administration of BHB increased the BHB level of hippocampus, and limited neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity damage in sepsis mice. Intracerebroventricular administration of BHB also alleviated neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment of sepsis surviving mice. In the coculture of neurons, astrocytes, and BV2 cells (a microglial cell line), knocking down the expression of microglial HCA2 (BHB receptor) via a specific shRNA reduced the protection of BHB to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and neuron damage more significantly than knocking down neuronal MCT2 (BHB transporter). These data showed that (1) BHB was a potential pharmacological adjunct treatment for prevention of post-sepsis cognitive impairment and (2) inhibiting neuroinflammation via HCA2 was an important mechanism.;Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body synthesized during fasting or strenuous exercise. Our previous study demonstrated that a cyclic ketogenic diet (KD), which induces BHB levels similar to fasting every other week, reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice. BHB actively regulates gene expression and inflammatory activation through non-energetic signaling pathways. Neither of these activities has been well-characterized in the brain and they may represent mechanisms by which BHB affects brain function during aging. First, we analyzed hepatic gene expression in an aging KD-treated mouse cohort using bulk RNA-seq. In addition to the downregulation of TOR pathway activity, cyclic KD reduces inflammatory gene expression in the liver. We observed via flow cytometry that KD also modulates age-related systemic T cell functions. Next, we investigated whether BHB affects brain cells transcriptionally in vitro. Gene expression analysis in primary human brain cells (microglia, astrocytes, neurons) using RNA-seq shows that BHB causes a mild level of inflammation in all three cell types. However, BHB inhibits the more pronounced LPS-induced inflammatory gene activation in microglia. Furthermore, we confirmed that BHB similarly reduces LPS-induced inflammation in primary mouse microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BHB is recognized as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, and an agonist of the GPCR Hcar2. Nevertheless, in microglia, BHB's anti-inflammatory effects are independent of these known mechanisms. Finally, we examined the brain gene expression of 12-month-old male mice fed with one-week and one-year cyclic KD. While a one-week KD increases inflammatory signaling, a one-year cyclic KD reduces neuroinflammation induced by aging. In summary, our findings demonstrate that BHB mitigates the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli, like LPS, possibly leading to decreased chronic inflammation in the brain after long-term KD treatment in aging mice.;Osteoarthritis (OA) is widely recognized as the prevailing joint disease associated with aging. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been postulated to impede the advancement of various inflammatory ailments. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), a prominent constituent of ketone bodies, has recently been proposed to possess crucial signaling capabilities. In this study, we propose to explore the role and mechanism of betaOHB in OA. Tissue staining and inflammatory factor assay were employed to evaluate the impacts of KD and betaOHB on OA rats. The oxidative stress conditions in chondrocytes were induced using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The mechanisms were determined using the siRNA of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), the antagonist of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the inhibitor of mitophagy. The administration of KD demonstrated a reduction in pathological damage to cartilage, as well as a decrease in plasma levels of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, it resulted in an increase in the concentration of betaOHB in the blood and synovial fluid. In vitro experiments showed that betaOHB facilitated mitophagy and adenosine triphosphate production. Besides, betaOHB mitigated chondrocyte senescence, inflammatory factors secretion, extracellular matrix degradation, and apoptosis induced by TBHP. Subsequent investigations indicated that the protective effects of betaOHB were no longer observed following the knockdown of HCAR2, the antagonist of AMPK, or the inhibitor of mitophagy. Moreover, in vivo studies suggested that betaOHB played a protective role by targeting the HCAR2-AMPK-PINK1 axis. In conclusion, betaOHB enhanced chondrocyte mitophagy through the HCAR2/AMPK/PINK1/Parkin pathway, offering a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of OA."

We report that the ketone body d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) is an endogenous and specific inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). Administration of exogenous betaOHB, or fasting or calorie restriction, two conditions associated with increased betaOHB abundance, all increased global histone acetylation in mouse tissues. Inhibition of HDAC by betaOHB was correlated with global changes in transcription, including that of the genes encoding oxidative stress resistance factors FOXO3A and MT2. Treatment of cells with betaOHB increased histone acetylation at the Foxo3a and Mt2 promoters, and both genes were activated by selective depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Consistent with increased FOXO3A and MT2 activity, treatment of mice with betaOHB conferred substantial protection against oxidative stress.;The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), is reported to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate effects of betaOHB on suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in in vivo and in vitro models. Rats were fed with ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) for 3 weeks. A C5 hemi-contusion injury was applied to these animals on the 14th day of experiment, and spinal cord samples were harvested on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after SCI, respectively. The blood ketone levels were significantly higher in the KD groups. KD reduced oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products, downregulated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and upregulated the expression of forkhead box group O (FOXO)3a, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and catalase after SCI. The in vitro study, performed on PC12 cells, indicated that betaOHB inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production, decreased NOX2 and NOX4 protein levels, and upregulated FOXO3a, MnSOD, and catalase levels in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the in vivo results. The ketone metabolite betaOHB inhibited HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 activity, but not HDAC8 in SCI rats and PC12 cells. Depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production and protein carbonylation and elevated FOXO3a protein levels, meanwhile reducing NOX2 and NOX4 protein expression in PC12 cells. Our results indicate that the ketone metabolite betaOHB attenuates oxidative stress in SCI by inhibition of class I HDACs, and selected suppression of HDAC1 or HDAC2 regulates FOXO3a, NOX2, and NOX4 expression. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.;Ketogenic diet (KD) alleviates refractory epilepsy and reduces seizures in children. However, the metabolic/cell biologic mechanisms by which the KD exerts its antiepileptic efficacy remain elusive. Herein, we report that KD-produced beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) augments brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit epilepsy. The KD ameliorated pentetrazol-induced epilepsy in mice. Mechanistically, KD-produced BHB, but not other ketone bodies, inhibited HDAC1/HDAC2, increased H3K27 acetylation, and transcriptionally upregulated SIRT4 and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1). BHB-induced SIRT4 de-carbamylated and inactivated glutamate dehydrogenase to preserve glutamate for GABA synthesis, and GAD1 upregulation increased mouse brain GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit neuron excitation. BHB administration in mice inhibited epilepsy induced by pentetrazol. BHB-mediated relief of epilepsy required high GABA level and GABA/glutamate ratio. These results identified BHB as the major antiepileptic metabolite of the KD and suggested that BHB may serve as an alternative and less toxic antiepileptic agent than KD.;ADORA3 is mainly expressed in intestinal tract, and has the potential to promote the expression of mucin 2 (MUC2), the function-related factor of goblet cells, under asthma conditions. This study aims to confirm the induction and mechanisms of ADORA3 activation on goblet cells in ulcerative colitis (UC). A significant decrease in ADORA3 expression was found in mucosal biopsies from UC patients and in the colons of colitis mice. This reduction correlated negatively with disease severity and positively with goblet cell number. ADORA3 activation mitigated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and facilitated ATOH1-mediated goblet cell differentiation in both in vivo and in vitro. Metabolomics analysis unveiled that ADORA3 activation bolstered ketogenesis, leading to elevated levels of the metabolite BHB. Subsequently, BHB heightened the activity of HDAC1/2, augmenting histone acetylation at the H3K9ac site within the promoter region of the ATOH1 gene. Furthermore, the reason for ADORA3 activation to enhance ketogenesis was attributed to controlling the competitive binding among beta-arrestin2, SHP1 and PPARgamma. This results in the non-ligand-dependent activation of PPARgamma, thereby promoting the transcription of HMGCS2. The exact mechanisms by which ADORA3 promoted goblet cell differentiation and alleviated UC were elucidated using MRS1191 and shHMGCS2 plasmid. Collectively, ADORA3 activation promoted goblet cell differentiation and alleviated UC by enhancing ketogenesis via the ""BHB-HDAC1/2-H3K9ac"" pathway."

However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain Bdnf gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on Bdnf gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur in vivo. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the Mus musculus Bdnf gene. The metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of Bdnf promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of beta-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective Bdnf promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal Bdnf expression were observed after direct ventricular application of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that beta-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF.;The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), is reported to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown.

Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.;Starvation and low carbohydrate diets lead to the accumulation of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), whose blood concentrations increase more than 10-fold into the millimolar range. In addition to providing a carbon source, BHB accumulation triggers lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of proteins via unknown mechanisms. As with other lysine acylation events, Kbhb marks can be removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we report that class I HDACs unexpectedly catalyze protein lysine modification with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Mutational analyses of the HDAC2 active site reveal a shared reliance on key amino acids for classical deacetylation and non-canonical HDAC-catalyzed beta-hydroxybutyrylation. Also consistent with reverse HDAC activity, Kbhb formation is driven by mass action and substrate availability. This reverse HDAC activity is not limited to BHB but also extends to multiple short-chain fatty acids. The reversible activity of class I HDACs described here represents a novel mechanism of PTM deposition relevant to metabolically-sensitive proteome modifications.;Ketogenic diet (KD) alleviates refractory epilepsy and reduces seizures in children.

Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.;The impairment of amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance in the brain plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Polarity distribution of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is important to remove Abeta from brain. AQP4 polarity can be influenced by the ratio of two AQP4 isoforms M1 and M23 (AQP4-M1/M23), however, it is unknown whether the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23 changes in AD. Histone deacetylase 3 has been reported to be significantly increased in AD brain. Moreover, evidence indicated that microRNA-130a (miR-130a) possibly mediates the regulation of histone deacetylase 3 on AQP4-M1/M23 ratio by repressing the transcriptional activity of AQP4-M1 in AD. This study aimed to investigate whether intermittent fasting (IF), increasing the level of an endogenous histone deacetylases inhibitor beta-hydroxybutyrate, restores AQP4 polarity via miR-130a mediated reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in protection against AD. The results showed that IF ameliorated cognitive dysfunction, prevented brain from Abeta deposition, and restored the AQP4 polarity in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice). Additionally, IF down-regulated the expression of AQP4-M1 and histone deacetylase 3, reduced AQP4-M1/M23 ratio, and increased miR-130a expression in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice. In vitro, beta-hydroxybutyrate was found to down-regulate the expression of AQP4-M1 and histone deacetylase 3, reduce AQP4-M1/M23 ratio, and increase AQP4-M23 and miR-130a expression in 2 muM Abeta-treated U251 cells. Interestingly, on the contrary to the result observed in 2 muM Abeta-treated cells, AQP4 expression was obviously decreased in cells exposed to 10 muM Abeta. miR-130a mimic decreased the expression of AQP4-M1 and the ratio of AQP4-M1/M23, as well as silencing histone deacetylase 3 caused the up-regulation of AQP4 and miR-130a, and the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in U251 cells. In conclusion, IF exhibits beneficial effects against AD. The mechanism may be associated with recovery of AQP4 polarity, resulting from the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate may partly mediate the effect of IF on the reduction of AQP4-M1/M23 ratio in AD, in which miR-130a and histone deacetylase 3 may be implicated.;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."
ENSG00000108840,HDAC5,0.29686418,weak,1,30851335,2019,Kidney,"beta-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, reduces the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin via activation of HDAC5 in human renal cortical epithelial cells.","AIMS: beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) is a metabolic intermediate that constitutes about 70% of ketone bodies produced in liver from oxidation of fatty acids released from adipose tissue. A recent study showed that betaOHB inhibits HDAC1, 3 and 4 (classes I and IIa) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Therefore, betaOHB could regulate epigenetics via modulating HDACs. However, little is known about the protective effect of betaOHB on renal cells through epigenetics. The aim of this study is to investigate whether betaOHB reduces cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in human renal cortical epithelial (HRCE) cells by modulating HDACs. MAIN METHODS: In this study, we used human renal cortical epithelial (HRCE) cells. The anti-apoptotic effect of betaOHB was evaluated using flow cytometry analysis. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins and HDACs was evaluated by western immunoblot. KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that betaOHB significantly reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HRCE cells. Furthermore, betaOHB significantly reduced cisplatin-induced cleavage of caspase-3, acetylation of histone H3, and phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase. This anti-apoptotic effect of betaOHB was markedly attenuated by an inhibitor of HDAC4/5, and betaOHB-mediated suppression of cleavage of caspase3 was significantly blocked by siRNA-induced gene silencing of HDAC5. SIGNIFICANCE: betaOHB attenuates cisplatin-induced apoptosis by activation of HDAC5 in HRCE cells, suggesting that betaOHB may be a new therapeutic agent for cisplatin nephropathy."

The regulators involved in glucagon response are less understood. This work aims to investigate the roles of mitochondrial beta-oxidation enzyme HADHA and its downstream ketone bodies in hepatic glucagon response. Here we show that glucagon challenge impairs expression of HADHA. Liver-specific HADHA overexpression reversed hepatic gluconeogenesis in mice, while HADHA knockdown augmented glucagon response. Stable isotope tracing shows that HADHA promotes ketone body production via beta-oxidation. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) but not acetoacetate suppresses gluconeogenesis by selectively inhibiting HDAC7 activity via interaction with Glu543 site to facilitate FOXO1 nuclear exclusion. In HFD-fed mice, HADHA overexpression improved metabolic disorders, and these effects are abrogated by knockdown of BHB-producing enzyme. In conclusion, BHB is responsible for the inhibitory effect of HADHA on hepatic glucagon response, suggesting that HADHA activation or BHB elevation by pharmacological intervention hold promise in treating diabetes."
ENSG00000048052,HDAC9,0.22157678,weak,1,35894849,2022,Vasculature,Downregulation of HDAC9 by the ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate suppresses vascular calcification.,"Vascular calcification is an actively regulated process resembling bone formation and contributes to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, an effective therapy for vascular calcification is still lacking. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been demonstrated to have health-promoting effects including anti-inflammation and cardiovascular protective effects. However, whether BHB protects against vascular calcification in CKD remains unclear. In this study, Alizarin Red staining and calcium content assay showed that BHB reduced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and arterial rings. Of note, compared with CKD patients without thoracic calcification, serum BHB levels were lower in CKD patients with thoracic calcification. Supplementation with 1,3-butanediol (1,3-B), the precursor of BHB, attenuated aortic calcification in CKD rats and VitD3-overloaded mice. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed that BHB downregulated HDAC9, which was further confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Both pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of HDAC9 attenuated calcification of human VSMCs, while overexpression of HDAC9 exacerbated calcification of VSMCs and aortic rings, indicating that HDAC9 promotes vascular calcification under CKD conditions. Of note, BHB treatment antagonized HDAC9-induced vascular calcification. In addition, HDAC9 overexpression activated the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-kappaB attenuated HDAC9-induced VSMC calcification, suggesting that HDAC9 promotes vascular calcification via activation of NF-kappaB. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BHB supplementation inhibits vascular calcification in CKD via modulation of the HDAC9-dependent NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Moreover, we unveil a crucial mechanistic role of HDAC9 in vascular calcification under CKD conditions, thus, nutritional intervention or pharmacological approaches to enhance BHB levels could act as promising therapeutic strategies to target HDAC9 for the treatment of vascular calcification in CKD.

The rationale that the utilization of ketones by the brain results in elevation of intracellular succinate, a known inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase (the enzyme responsible for the degradation of HIF-1alpha) was deemed as a potential mechanism of ketosis on the upregulation of HIF-1alpha. The neuroprotective effect of diet-induced ketosis (3 weeks of feeding a ketogenic diet), as pretreatment, on infarct volume, after reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the upregulation of HIF-1alpha were investigated. The effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), as a pretreatment, via intraventricular infusion (4 days of infusion before stroke) was also investigated following MCAO. Levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) proteins and succinate content were measured. A 55% or 70% reduction in infarct volume was observed with BHB infusion or diet-induced ketosis, respectively. The levels of HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 proteins increased threefold with diet-induced ketosis, BHB infusions also resulted in increases in these proteins. As hypothesized, succinate content increased by 55% with diet-induced ketosis and fourfold with BHB infusion. In conclusion, the biochemical link between ketosis and the stabilization of HIF-1alpha is through the elevation of succinate, and both HIF-1alpha stabilization and Bcl-2 upregulation play a role in ketone-induced neuroprotection in the brain.;Over the past decade we have consistently shown that ketosis is neuroprotective against ischemic insults in rats. We reported that diet-induced ketotic rats had a significant reduction in infarct volume when subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and improved survival and recovery after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The neuroprotective mechanisms of ketosis (via ketogenic diet, KG) include (i) ketones are alternate energy substrates that can restore energy balance when glucose metabolism is deficient and (ii) ketones modulate cell-signalling pathways that are cytoprotective. We investigated the effects of diet-induced ketosis following transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice. The correlation between levels of ketosis and hypoxic inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), AKT (also known as protein kinase B or PKB) and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were determined. Mice were fed with KG diet or standard lab-chow (STD) diet for 4 weeks. For the MCAO group, mice underwent 60 min of MCAO and total brain infarct volumes were evaluated 48 h after reperfusion. In a separate group of mice, brain tissue metabolites, levels of HIF-1alpha, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), and AMPK were measured. After feeding a KG diet, levels of blood ketone bodies (beta-hydroxyburyrate, BHB) were increased. There was a proportional decrease in infarct volumes with increased blood BHB levels (KG vs STD, 4.2 +/- 0.6 vs 7.8 +/- 2.2 mm(3), mean +/- SEM). A positive correlation was also observed with HIF-1alpha and pAKT relative to blood BHB levels. Our results showed that chronic ketosis can be induced in mice by KG diet and was neuroprotective against focal cerebral ischemia in a concentration dependent manner. Potential mechanisms include upregulation of cytoprotective pathways such as those associated with HIF-1alpha, pAKT and AMPK.;PURPOSE: Ketone body oxidation yields more ATP per mole of consumed oxygen than glucose. However, whether an increased ketone body supply in hypoxic cardiomyocytes and ischemic hearts is protective or not remains elusive. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), the main constituent of ketone bodies, on cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions and the effects of ketogenic diet (KD) on cardiac function in a myocardial infarction (MI) mouse model. METHODS: Human peripheral blood collected from patients with acute myocardial infarction and healthy volunteers was used to detect the level of beta-OHB. N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) were measured to study the relationship between plasma beta-OHB and cardiac function. Adult mouse cardiomyocytes and MI mouse models fed a KD were used to research the effect of beta-OHB on cardiac damage. qPCR, western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence were used to detect the interaction between beta-OHB and glycolysis. Live/dead cell staining and imaging, lactate dehydrogenase, Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, echocardiography, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining were performed to evaluate the cardiomyocyte death, cardiac function, and infarct sizes. RESULTS: beta-OHB level was significantly higher in acute MI patients and MI mice. Treatment with beta-OHB exacerbated cardiomyocyte death and decreased glucose absorption and glycolysis under hypoxic conditions. These effects were partially ameliorated by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) degradation via roxadustat administration in hypoxia-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, beta-OHB metabolisms were obscured in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, MI mice fed a KD exhibited exacerbated cardiac dysfunction compared with control chow diet (CD)-fed MI mice. CONCLUSION: Elevated beta-OHB levels may be maladaptive to the heart under hypoxic/ischemic conditions. Administration of roxadustat can partially reverse these harmful effects by stabilizing HIF-1alpha and inducing a metabolic shift toward glycolysis for energy production."

Diet restriction reduces liver damage by increasing stress resistance, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the preventive effect of 12-h fasting on mouse liver IRI. Partial warm hepatic IRI model in wild-type male C57BL/6 mice was used. The control ischemia and reperfusion (IR) group of mice was given food and water ad libitum, while the fasting IR group was given water but not food for 12 h before ischemic insult. In 12-h fasting mice, serum liver-derived enzyme level and tissue damages due to IR were strongly suppressed. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was significantly raised before ischemia and during reperfusion. Up-regulated BHB induced an increment in the expression of FOXO1 transcription factor by raising the level of acetylated histone. Antioxidative enzyme heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a target gene of FOXO1, then increased. Autophagy activity was also enhanced. Serum high-mobility group box 1 was remarkably lowered by the 12-h fasting, and activation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production and liver injury were reduced. Exogenous BHB administration or histone deacetylase inhibitor administration into the control fed mice ameliorated liver IRI, while FOXO1 inhibitor administration to the 12-h fasting group exacerbated liver IRI. The 12-h fasting exerted beneficial effects on the prevention of liver IRI by increasing BHB, thus up-regulating FOXO1 and HO-1, and by reducing the inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death via the down-regulation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome."

We hypothesized that these dynamic health benefits of beta-hydroxybutyrate might stem from its ability to regulate genome architecture through chromatin remodeling via histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, thereby influencing the transcriptome. Focusing on the kidney, which is an end organ protected by beta-hydroxybutyrate, we examined histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation-mediated chromatin remodeling. Notably, regions of the genome associated with lipid catabolism were predominantly in an open chromatin configuration, leading to active transcription and translation. Significant beta-hydroxybutyrylation was observed in the kidneys and the most highly upregulated gene actively transcribed and translated was 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl CoA Synthase 2 ( Hmgcs2 ), a gene responsible for the biosynthesis of beta-hydroxybutyrate in mitochondria. In contrast, regions with more compact chromatin structures were enriched with genes related to immune function such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C ( Ptprc ) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 ( Lcp1 ), which exhibited reduced transcription and translation. These results reveal that renal epigenetic histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, which concurrently modulates both energy metabolism and immune function is a mechanism underlying the dynamic health effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate to protect kidneys and lower hypertension.;beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB, 3-hydroxybutyric acid) may serve as a signaling metabolite in many physiological processes beyond a fuel source for tissues. However, whether and how it is involved in ketone body metabolism is still unknown. The present study aims to investigate the role of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) modification mediated by beta-HB in regulating ketone body metabolic homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. The starvation ketosis and type 1 diabetes mouse models were introduced to evaluate the influence of beta-HB on Kbhb modification in mice. The Kbhb modifications of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1) and HMG-CoA synthase 2, two rate-limiting enzymes involved in ketogenesis and utilization, showed a positive correlation with the level of beta-HB both in vitro and in vivo. The modification levels of the enzymes increased during fasting but decreased after refeeding. However, the Kbhb modification level in all detected tissues showed minor change since the blood ketone body increased nonsignificantly in the type 1 diabetes mouse model. The in vitro experiments further indicated that mutation at the Kbhb modification site significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity of OXCT1 but not HMG-CoA synthase 2. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) were identified both in vitro and in vivo as potential Kbhb dehydrogenase and transferase for OXCT1, respectively. Kbhb modification at lysine 421 of OXCT1 increases its enzyme activity during beta-HB accumulation, accelerating the utilization of the ketone body and finally maintaining metabolism homeostasis. Our present study proposes a new ketone body metabolic regulatory mode primarily mediated by Kbhb modifications of OXCT1 during beta-HB accumulation."

ENSG00000168453,HR,,weak,1,34798244,2022,Heart,Acute Echocardiographic Effects of Exogenous Ketone Administration in Healthy Participants.,"BACKGROUND: Interest in therapeutic applications of exogenous ketones has grown significantly, spanning patients with heart failure to endurance athletes. Exogenous ketones engender significant effects on cardiac function in heart failure and provide an ergogenic benefit in athletes. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exogenous ketones on cardiac function in healthy participants. METHODS: In a single-arm intervention study, 20 fasting, healthy participants underwent comprehensive echocardiography (two-dimensional, Doppler, and strain) before and 30 min after weight-based oral ketone ester administration. The relationship between changes in log-transformed biomarker levels and change in absolute global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed using linear regression. RESULTS: The mean age was 30 +/- 7 years, 50% were women, 45% were nonwhite, and the average body mass index was 24.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2). Ketone ingestion acutely elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels from a median of 0.13 mmol/L (interquartile range, 0.10-0.37 mmol/L) to 3.23 mmol/L (interquartile range, 2.40-4.97 mmol/L) (P < .001). After ketone ester consumption, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biventricular function, left ventricular GLS, and left atrial (LA) strain all augmented, while systemic vascular resistance decreased. Displayed as mean change, increases in ejection fraction (3.1%, 95% CI, 2.0%-4.2%, P < .001), GLS (2.0%, 95% CI, 1.4%-2.7%, P < .001), right ventricular S' (1.1 cm/sec, 95% CI, 0.4-1.8 cm/sec, P = .004), LA reservoir strain (7%, 95% CI, 3%-12%, P = .005), and LA contractile strain (4%, 2%-6%, P = .001) were observed. During robustly achieved ketosis, change in GLS was inversely associated with change in nonesterified fatty acids (P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: In a single-arm study, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, biventricular function, and LV and LA strain acutely augmented after ketone ester ingestion in healthy, fasting participants, similar to several effects observed in the failing heart. These data may provide supporting data for the ergogenic benefits observed in athletes and may become increasingly relevant with exogenous ketone consumption across a variety of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular applications."

The present study sought to investigate whether a ketogenic diet also improves insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle cells through alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. METHODS: High-fat diet-induced IR mice were allowed to a 2-week ketogenic diet. Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were evaluated through GTT, ITT, and HOMA-IR. The C2C12 myoblasts exposed to palmitic acid were used to evaluate the insulin sensitization effects of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB). Molecular mechanisms concerning ER stress signaling activation and glucose uptake were assessed. RESULTS: The AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited, ER stress signaling associated with IRE1, PERK, and BIP was activated, and the number of Glut4 proteins translocated to membrane decreased in the muscle of HFD mice. However, all these changes were reversed after 2 weeks of feeding on a ketogenic diet. Consistently in C2C12 myoblasts, the AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, IRE1, and BIP were increased, and the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane decreased. However, beta-OHB treatment alleviated ER stress and improved the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that KD ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, which was partially mediated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. The insulin sensitization effect of beta-OHB is associated with up regulation of AKT/GSK3beta pathway and the increase in the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane."

The isolated perfused normal rat pancreas was used to evaluate the effects of glucose and insulin secretagogues, such as arginine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and gliclazide, on amylin secretion. Glucose and the other stimulants tested elicited a significant release of amylin from the rat pancreas in a biphasic pattern, similar to that of insulin. Dose-response studies of the glucose-induced release of amylin and insulin revealed that they possessed a similar dependency on glucose. However, the release of amylin induced by high concentrations of glucose was partially dissociated from that of insulin, that is, the amylin-insulin molar ratios induced by 22.2 and 33.3 mM glucose (1.11 +/- 0.05 and 1.05 +/- 0.04%, respectively) were significantly higher than those induced by 16.7 mM glucose (0.90 +/- 0.04%, P less than 0.01 vs. 22.2 mM glucose, P less than 0.05 vs. 33.3 mM glucose). Additionally, when the basal concentration of glucose in the perfusate was increased from 5.6 to 11.1 mM, the response of amylin was unchanged. These data suggest that amylin may be an islet hormone whose abundant response to high concentrations of glucose might contribute to the oversecretion of amylin in the hyperglycemia that accompanies diabetes mellitus."

We hypothesized that the use of energy substrates, such as ketone bodies, in the resuscitation fluids would protect against this injury. As markers of cellular injury we measured the induction of apoptotic cell death and the expression of Intracellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1). STUDY DESIGN: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 35) under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia had placement of femoral arterial and venous catheters. A three-stage hemorrhage model was used for this experiment. There was an initial hemorrhage of 27 mL/kg for 10 minutes. During the next 75 minutes another 8 mL/kg of blood was withdrawn at a steady rate. The resuscitation fluids were then infused for 45 minutes during which the third continuous hemorrhage of 8 mL/kg was performed. The animals were randomized to five groups: 1) sham hemorrhage (n = 6), 2) sham resuscitation (n = 7), 3) Lactated Ringer's resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 8), 4) Ketone Ringer's (containing 28 mEq/L of beta-hydroxybutyrate) resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 7), and 5) plasma resuscitation, volume equal to shed blood (n = 7). The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after resuscitation and lungs were harvested. Western blot technique was used for the determination of proapoptotic protein (bax), antiapoptotic protein (bcl-2), apoptotic fragments of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, and ICAM-1. Sections of lung were also subjected to immunostaining using antibodies to bax and ICAM-1 proteins (reported as number of positive cells/mm2). RESULTS: Lactated Ringer's resuscitation caused a significant increase in pulmonary apoptosis and ICAM-1 expression compared with the sham hemorrhage group. Animals resuscitated with Ketone Ringer's solution and plasma did not show this injury pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of lactate with ketone bodies in the resuscitation fluid attenuates the expression of cellular injury markers in the lung.;It has been hypothesized that ketone bodies cause activation of brain endothelial cells and that this is a factor in the intracerebral crises of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In this study we used cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) to investigate the effect of beta hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) on the expression of the adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Increasing concentrations of AcAc, but not BOHB, caused a significant upregulation of ICAM-1 in comparison to unstimulated cells. Glucose concentrations of 10 and 30 mM, but not 50 mM, also resulted in increased expression of ICAM-1. These results support the hypothesis that activation of HBMEC is involved in the acute complications of DKA, and that ketone bodies and hyperglycemia are factors in the perturbed membrane function.;Type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients are hyperglycemic and also show elevated blood levels of ketone bodies, particularly acetoacetate (AA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). T1D patients have a greater risk of developing endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Supplementation with cysteine-rich milk proteins has been shown to be beneficial in improving various biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and CVD. This study examines whether L-cysteine (LC) per se prevents monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, a critical step in endothelial dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and THP-1 monocytes were pretreated with and without LC (500 muM) for 2 h and then exposed to ketones (AA or BHB, 0-4 mM) and/or high glucose (HG) (25 mM) for 24 h. This study shows that LC reduces HG and ketone-induced ROS production, ICAM-1 expression, and the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. This study provides a biochemical mechanism by which milk protein supplementation can be beneficial in preventing the excess endothelial dysfunction and CVD seen in diabetic patients."

Participants ingested 0.35 g kg(-1) of BD or placebo 30 min before and 60 min during 85 min of steady-state (SS) exercise, which preceded a ~ 30 min time-trial (TT) (7 kJ kg(-1)). Blood samples were collected at pre-supplement, pre-exercise, post-SS, post-TT and 1-h post-TT. Whole blood cultures were stimulated with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) for 24 h to determine T-cell-related interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA expression within isolated PBMCs in vitro. RESULTS: Serum cortisol, total circulating leukocyte and lymphocyte, and T-cell subset concentrations were similar between trials during exercise and recovery (all p > 0.05). BD ingestion increased T-cell-related IFN-gamma mRNA expression compared with placebo throughout exercise and recovery (p = 0.011), however, IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA expression and the IFN-gamma/IL-4 mRNA expression ratio were unaltered (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acute hyperketonaemia appears to transiently amplify the initiation of the pro-inflammatory T-cell-related IFN-gamma response to an immune challenge in vitro during and following prolonged, strenuous exercise, suggesting enhanced type-1 T-cell immunity at the gene level.;Anorexia and fasting are host adaptations to acute infection, and induce a metabolic switch towards ketogenesis and the production of ketone bodies, including beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)(1-6). However, whether ketogenesis metabolically influences the immune response in pulmonary infections remains unclear. Here we show that the production of BHB is impaired in individuals with SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but not in those with  influenza-induced ARDS. We found that BHB promotes both the survival of and the production of interferon-gamma by CD4(+) T cells. Applying a metabolic-tracing analysis, we established that BHB provides an alternative carbon source to fuel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the production of bioenergetic amino acids and glutathione, which is important for maintaining the redox balance. T cells from patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS were exhausted and skewed towards glycolysis, but could be metabolically reprogrammed by BHB to perform OXPHOS, thereby increasing their functionality. Finally, we show in mice that a ketogenic diet and the delivery of BHB as a ketone ester drink restores CD4(+) T cell metabolism and function in severe respiratory infections, ultimately reducing the mortality of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our data reveal that BHB is an alternative source of carbon that promotes T cell responses in pulmonary viral infections, and highlight impaired ketogenesis as a potential confounding factor in severe COVID-19.;Pre-clinical and cell culture evidence supports the role of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an immunomodulatory molecule that may inhibit inflammatory signalling involved in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies in humans are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time."
ENSG00000211899,IGHM,,weak,1,11911577,2002,NS,Effects of nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate on functions of mononuclear cells obtained from ewes.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) on functions of mononuclear cells obtained from ewes. ANIMALS: 6 Sardinian ewes. PROCEDURE: Mononuclear cells were cultured with concentrations of NEFA (0, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 micromol/L) and BHBA (0, 0.45, 0.9, 1.8, or 3.6 mmol/L). Concentrations of NEFA and BHBA were intended to mimic those of ketotic or healthy ewes, and NEFA and BHBA were tested alone and in combination. Synthesis of DNA was stimulated by use of concanavalin A (Con A) or pokeweed-mitogen (PWM). Secretion of IgM was stimulated by use of PWM. RESULTS: Synthesis of DNA stimulated by Con A and PWM was significantly inhibited by high concentrations of NEFA (> or = 250 micromol/L) or by a combination of high concentrations of NEFA (> or = 250 micromol/L) and all concentrations of BHBA (> or = 0.45 mmol/L). In contrast, DNA synthesis was not inhibited by low concentrations of NEFA (< or = 125 micromol/L) or by a combination of low concentrations of NEFA (< or = 125 micromol/L) and the lowest concentration of BHBA (0.45 mmol/L). Secretion of IgM was significantly inhibited by all concentrations of NEFA and by all combinations of NEFA and BHBA concentrations. When used alone, none of the concentrations of BHBA inhibited DNA synthesis or IgM secretion. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Reduced immunoresponsiveness during ketosis is likely to be associated with an increase in plasma concentration of NEFA and not with an increase in plasma concentration of BH BA."

The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease. METHODS: We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection. RESULTS: Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) induced by BHB. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. LAY SUMMARY: Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and beta-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.;Thirty-seven million people in the United States are estimated to have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension (HTN) is the second leading risk factor for developing kidney disease. A recent study reported that increasing levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels by administration of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, decreased salt-induced HTN in male Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats. The effect of 1,3-butanediol on hypertensive kidney disease in female rats or the absence of high salt has not been investigated. This study tested the hypothesis that 1,3-butanediol attenuates HTN and the progression of CKD in female S-SHR(11) rats. The S-SHR(11) strain is a congenic rat strain generated from genetic modification of the Dahl S rat, previously characterized as a model of accelerated renal disease. Rats received 1,3-butanediol (20% via drinking water) or control for 10 wk and were maintained on a 0.3% NaCl rodent diet (n = 12-14 rats/group). Blood pressure was measured after 6 and 9 wk of treatment by tail-cuff plethysmography, after 10 wk, urine and tissues were collected. Activity of the treatment was confirmed by measuring plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, which were greater in the treated group. The 1,3-butanediol-treated group had lower systolic blood pressure, proteinuria, plasma creatinine, and renal fibrosis after 9 wk of treatment compared with controls. The treated group had significantly smaller spleens and increased the renal anti-inflammatory molecules interleukin-10 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, suggesting reduced inflammation. The present data demonstrate that 1,3-butanediol lowers blood pressure and renal injury in female rats and could be a novel nutritional intervention for the treatment of CKD.;BACKGROUND: Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has received more and more attentions, because it possesses a lot of beneficial, life-preserving effects in the fields of clinical science and medicine. However, the role of BHB in intestinal inflammation has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy controls were collected for evaluation of BHB level. Besides, the therapeutic effect of exogenous BHB in a murine model of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were assessed by body weight change, colon length, disease activity index, and histopathological sections. The regulatory effectors of BHB were analyzed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and microbe analysis in vivo. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of BHB was further verified in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). RESULTS: In this study, significantly reduced BHB levels were found in the colonic mucosa from IBD patients and correlated with IBD activity index. In addition, we demonstrated that the administration of exogenous BHB alleviated the severity of acute experimental colitis, which was characterized by less weight loss, disease activity index, colon shortening, and histology scores, as well as decreased crypt loss and epithelium damage. Furthermore, BHB resulted in significantly increased colonic expression of M2 macrophage-associated genes, including IL-4Ra, IL-10, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and chitinase-like protein 3, following DSS exposure, suggesting an increased M2 macrophage skewing in vivo. Moreover, an in vitro experiment revealed that the addition of BHB directly promoted STAT6 phosphorylation and M2 macrophage-specific gene expression in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Besides, we found that BHB obviously increased M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair through promoting intestinal epithelial proliferation. However, the enhancement effect of BHB on M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair and anti-inflammation was completely inhibited by the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we show that BHB promotes M2 macrophage polarization through the STAT6-dependent signaling pathway, which contributes to the resolution of intestinal inflammation and the repair of damaged intestinal tissues. Our finding suggests that exogenous BHB supplement may be a useful therapeutic approach for IBD treatment.;Hyperketonemia is a common condition in early-lactation dairy cows that has been associated with an increase in the risk of infectious disease. Recent mouse studies have elucidated an anti-inflammatory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether BHB altered inflammatory responses in macrophages challenged with the common mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. A secondary objective was to determine whether the inflammatory response to the S. uberis challenge was dependent on whether BHB was present in the medium during the challenge (i.e., preconditioned vs. continuous treatment). Two cell culture experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 line) were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was then replaced with a standard cell culture medium, and the cells were challenged or not with S. uberis for an additional 6 h. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was used, however, cells were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of BHB, and cells were either challenged or not with S. uberis for 6 h. In both experiments, relative transcript abundance of cell membrane receptors (Tlr2 and Gpr109a), cytokines (Il1b, Il10, Tnf, and Tgfb1), and chemokines (Cxcl2 and Ccl5) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the geometric mean of Hprt and B2m. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model, and orthogonal contrasts were conducted to examine the effect of S. uberis challenge and BHB treatment. Streptococcus uberis activated the macrophages, noted by greater transcript abundance of analyzed genes. Intriguingly, in both experiments, the S. uberis challenge increased expression of Gpr109a, which encodes a receptor that is ligated by BHB. Paradoxically, preconditioning macrophages with BHB increased transcript abundance of the immunosuppressive cytokine Tgfb1 and increased that of the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl2. Preconditioning decreased Tlr2 and tended to decrease Il10 transcript abundance. In opposition to the preconditioning experiment, continuous treatment of BHB during the S. uberis challenge linearly increased abundance of Tlr2 and Il10 transcripts. Continuous BHB treatment also increased expression of Il1b. In conclusion, BHB treatment altered macrophage inflammatory responses during an S. uberis challenge, however, the direction of this response was dependent on whether BHB was added to the medium during the S. uberis challenge. Future studies should be conducted using bovine macrophages and in vivo approaches to examine BHB effects during an S. uberis challenge.;The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet high in fat and protein but low in carbohydrates, is gaining much interest due to its positive effects, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), the major ketone body produced during the carbohydrate deprivation that occurs in KD, is assumed to have neuroprotective effects, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are still unclear. Microglial cell activation plays a key role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in the production of several proinflammatory secondary metabolites. The following study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which BHB determines the activation processes of BV2 microglial cells, such as polarization, cell migration and expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, in the absence or in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a proinflammatory stimulus. The results showed that BHB has a neuroprotective effect in BV2 cells, inducing both microglial polarization towards an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype and reducing migratory capacity following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, BHB significantly reduced expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. From this study, it can be concluded that BHB, and consequently the KD, has a fundamental role in neuroprotection and prevention in neurodegenerative diseases, presenting new therapeutic targets.;OBJECTIVE: Neointimal hyperplasia is the primary mechanism underlying atherosclerosis and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Ketogenic diet (KD) exerts beneficial effects in various diseases, but whether it could serve as non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KD on neointimal hyperplasia and the potential mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery balloon-injury model was employed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce neointimal hyperplasia. Then, animals were subjected to either standard rodent chow or KD. For in-vitro experiment, impacts of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the main mediator of KD effects, on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation were determined. Balloon injury induced event intimal hyperplasia and upregulation of protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and these changes were significantly ameliorated by KD. In addition, beta-HB could markedly inhibit PDGF-BB induced VMSC migration and proliferation, as well as inhibiting expressions of PCNA and alpha-SMC. Furthermore, KD inhibited balloon-injury induced oxidative stress in carotid artery, indicated by reduced ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We also found balloon-injury induced inflammation in carotid artery was suppressed by KD, indicated by decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: KD attenuates neointimal hyperplasia through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. KD may represent a promising non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia associated diseases.;Pre-clinical and cell culture evidence supports the role of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an immunomodulatory molecule that may inhibit inflammatory signalling involved in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies in humans are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time.;The ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to reduce anxiety and enhance cognitive functions in neurological diseases. However, the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers (Cd68, P2ry12) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex-specific decrease in IL1beta and an increase in IL-10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1beta, and cFos. Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL-10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1beta from human microglia in in-vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male-specific. Reduced pro-inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects."

We previously reported that, in obese mice, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ipragliflozin (Ipra) promoted the expansion of the epididymal adipose tissue (Epi) with increase of serum ketone body concentration. The Ipra-induced adipose tissue expansion did not deteriorate adipose inflammation, or systemic glucose/lipid metabolism, referred to as ""healthy adipose tissue expansion."" Here we found that Ipra promoted healthy adipose tissue expansion with a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory M1-like adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) to anti-inflammatory M2-like ATMs. Ipra downregulated the gene expression of interleukin (IL)-15 (Il15) in stromal cells of Epi. IL-15 inhibited lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells associated with downregulation of the lipogenic gene. Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed Il15 gene induction in M1-polarized cultured macrophages, and a ketogenic diet reproduced the adipose tissue expansion without deteriorating systemic glucose metabolism in mice. Our data indicate that the phenotypic switch of ATMs could mediate healthy adipose tissue expansion by treatment with Ipra, and it may offer new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adipose tissue expansion."

Dietary interventions, including the use of ketogenic diets, have been explored for their potential to reduce the adverse effects of hyperglycemia. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body, has immune and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to investigate whether BHB ameliorates the harmful effects induced by high glucose in ARPE-19 cells, a model of retinal pigment epithelium. We investigated the effects induced by high glucose and/or BHB on viability, migration, colony-forming ability, cell cycle progression and cytokine production. Our data indicate that high glucose significantly reduces the viability of ARPE-19 cells with no significant changes in apoptosis or autophagy, while inducing cell cytostasis. On the other hand, BHB exerts a protective effect on ARPE-19 cells under hyperglycemic conditions improving cell viability and alleviating glucose-induced cell cycle arrest. Additionally, BHB treatment affects the expression of IL-8 and IL-17alpha, as well as of MCP-1, modulating the inflammatory response, cell migration and wound healing. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential protective role of BHB against the detrimental effects induced by high glucose on ARPE-19 cells. These findings support the use of ketone bodies in mitigating high glucose-induced cellular damage. Future research will be critical to translate these findings to the clinical practice for metabolic diseases."

The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of administration of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in spinal cord-injured mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given a moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury at the T(9-10) level and treated with exogenous DBHB. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of SCI mice with DBHB markedly improved locomotor function and relieved SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation. DBHB treatment partly prevented the SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and suppressed microglial and glial activation. DBHB treatment enhanced histone acetylation and up-regulated expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, catalase and SOD2 in injured region of SCI mice. DBHB treatment suppressed SCI-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced protein expression of IL-1beta and IL-18. In addition, DBHB treatment improved mitochondrial function and abated oxidative stress following SCI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DBHB promoted functional recovery and relieved pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through inhibition of histone deacetylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preservation of mitochondrial function. DBHB could thus be envisaged as a potential use of interventions for SCI but remains to be tested in humans.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.;Cisplatin, as a commonly used anticancer drug, can easily lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), and has received more and more attention in clinical practice. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) is a metabolite in the body and acts as an inhibitor of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing inflammatory responses and apoptosis. However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for the majority of cases, is sturdily influenced by lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, obesity, and diabetes, leading to its classification as Type 3 diabetes. To model this pathological link, our AD-like model was developed by feeding Wistar male rats a high-fat diet with fructose in drinking water (HFFD) for 8 weeks, followed by a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This group was compared with a normal control group fed a standard diet and a beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-treated group (125 mg/kg, p.o.), administered starting 3 h after LPS and continuing for 1 week. The results demonstrate that BHB treatment illuminated cognitive gains, as indicated by the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1beta/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function."

Neutrophil-mediated production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) drives gouty flares that cause joint destruction, intense pain, and fever. However, metabolites that impact neutrophil inflammasome remain unknown. Here, we identified that ketogenic diet (KD) increases beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and alleviates urate crystal-induced gout without impairing immune defense against bacterial infection. BHB inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome in S100A9 fibril-primed and urate crystal-activated macrophages, which serve to recruit inflammatory neutrophils in joints. Consistent with reduced gouty flares in rats fed a ketogenic diet, BHB blocked IL-1beta in neutrophils in a NLRP3-dependent manner in mice and humans irrespective of age. Mechanistically, BHB inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils by reducing priming and assembly steps. Collectively, our studies show that BHB, a known alternate metabolic fuel, is also an anti-inflammatory molecule that may serve as a treatment for gout.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe motor and sensory dysfunction and significantly reduces the quality of life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of administration of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in spinal cord-injured mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given a moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury at the T(9-10) level and treated with exogenous DBHB. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of SCI mice with DBHB markedly improved locomotor function and relieved SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation. DBHB treatment partly prevented the SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and suppressed microglial and glial activation. DBHB treatment enhanced histone acetylation and up-regulated expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, catalase and SOD2 in injured region of SCI mice. DBHB treatment suppressed SCI-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced protein expression of IL-1beta and IL-18. In addition, DBHB treatment improved mitochondrial function and abated oxidative stress following SCI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DBHB promoted functional recovery and relieved pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through inhibition of histone deacetylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preservation of mitochondrial function. DBHB could thus be envisaged as a potential use of interventions for SCI but remains to be tested in humans.;SCOPE: Cell culture studies indicate that the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) directly inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation. However, direct evidence demonstrating this effect in humans is lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effects of acutely raising blood beta-OHB in healthy humans, two separate randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experiments are conducted using similar methods but each employed different exogenous ketone supplements. Participants' blood beta-OHB is directly elevated by ketone salts (0.3 g beta-OHB per kg, Study 1, N = 10 males) or ketone monoester (0.482 g beta-OHB per kg, Study 2, N = 18, equal males/females). Markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation include caspase-1, IL-1beta secretion, and IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA in LPS-stimulated whole blood collected at the baseline and 30 minutes following supplementation. Caspase-1 activation increases after ketone salt (Study 1: condition x time interaction, p = 0.012) and monoester supplementation (Study 2: condition x time interaction, p = 0.016) compared to placebo. IL-1beta secretion increases (main effect of condition, p = 0.024, Study 2) while IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA remain unchanged. CONCLUSION: Measures of NLRP3 activation increases when blood beta-OHB is elevated using ketone supplements, suggesting that increasing beta-OHB exogenously may have unintended effects that augment inflammatory activation.;Activation of the NOD-like receptor pyrin-domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in metabolic diseases such as obesity. Mechanistic studies have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) attenuates activation of NLRP3, but human data are limited. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial (n = 11) we tested the hypothesis that acutely raising beta-OHB by ingestion of exogenous ketones would attenuate NLRP3 activation in humans with obesity. Blood was sampled before and 30 min post-ingestion of a ketone monoester drink ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, 482 mg/kg body mass) or placebo. A 75 g oral glucose load was then ingested, and a third blood sample was obtained 60 min following glucose ingestion. NLRP3 activation was quantified by assessing monocyte caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1beta secretion in ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated whole-blood cultures. LPS-stimulated caspase-1 activation increased following glucose ingestion (main effect of time, p = 0.032), with no differences between conditions. IL-1beta secretion did not differ between conditions but was lower 60 min post-glucose ingestion compared to the fasting baseline (main effect of time, p = 0.014). Plasma IL-1beta was detectable in ~80% of samples and showed a decrease from fasting baseline to 60 min in the ketone condition only (condition x time interaction, p = 0.01). In individuals with obesity, an excursion into hyperglycemia following ingestion of a glucose load augments LPS-induced activation of caspase-1 in monocytes with no apparent impact of raising circulating beta-OHB concentration via ingestion of exogenous ketones. Exogenous ketone supplementation may impact plasma IL-1beta, but these findings require confirmation in studies with larger sample sizes.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.;Chronic, low-grade inflammation is associated with the development of numerous diseases and is mediated in part by overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome and alters intracellular signalling pathways in vitro and in animal models, however, this effect has not yet been shown in vivo in humans. The purpose of this single-arm pilot trial was to determine if consuming 15 mL of C(8) medium-chain triglyceride (trioctanoin, MCT) oil, which induces mild elevation of betaHB, twice daily (30 mL total) for 14 days would suppress markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in young, healthy humans while following their habitual diet. Consuming a single dose of 15 mL of C(8) MCT oil significantly raised blood betaHB from fasting at 60 minutes and 120 minutes post ingestion (both P < 0.05). However, consumption of C(8) MCT oil for 14 days did not impact markers of monocyte NLRP3 inflammasome activation compared to baseline. Specifically, caspase-1 activation and secretion of its downstream product interleukin (IL)-1beta were unchanged following 14 days of C(8) MCT oil supplementation when measured in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures (all P > 0.05). Acetylation of histone H3 on the lysine residue 9 was unchanged (P < 0.05) and acetylation of lysine residue 14 was decreased (P < 0.05) following 14 days of supplementation. Thus, adding twice daily C(8) MCT oil supplementation to the habitual diet of young, healthy humans does not appear to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation.;Cisplatin, as a commonly used anticancer drug, can easily lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), and has received more and more attention in clinical practice. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) is a metabolite in the body and acts as an inhibitor of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing inflammatory responses and apoptosis. However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway.;Hyperketonemia is a common condition in early-lactation dairy cows that has been associated with an increase in the risk of infectious disease. Recent mouse studies have elucidated an anti-inflammatory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether BHB altered inflammatory responses in macrophages challenged with the common mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. A secondary objective was to determine whether the inflammatory response to the S. uberis challenge was dependent on whether BHB was present in the medium during the challenge (i.e., preconditioned vs. continuous treatment). Two cell culture experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 line) were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was then replaced with a standard cell culture medium, and the cells were challenged or not with S. uberis for an additional 6 h. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was used, however, cells were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of BHB, and cells were either challenged or not with S. uberis for 6 h. In both experiments, relative transcript abundance of cell membrane receptors (Tlr2 and Gpr109a), cytokines (Il1b, Il10, Tnf, and Tgfb1), and chemokines (Cxcl2 and Ccl5) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the geometric mean of Hprt and B2m. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model, and orthogonal contrasts were conducted to examine the effect of S. uberis challenge and BHB treatment. Streptococcus uberis activated the macrophages, noted by greater transcript abundance of analyzed genes. Intriguingly, in both experiments, the S. uberis challenge increased expression of Gpr109a, which encodes a receptor that is ligated by BHB. Paradoxically, preconditioning macrophages with BHB increased transcript abundance of the immunosuppressive cytokine Tgfb1 and increased that of the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl2. Preconditioning decreased Tlr2 and tended to decrease Il10 transcript abundance. In opposition to the preconditioning experiment, continuous treatment of BHB during the S. uberis challenge linearly increased abundance of Tlr2 and Il10 transcripts. Continuous BHB treatment also increased expression of Il1b. In conclusion, BHB treatment altered macrophage inflammatory responses during an S. uberis challenge, however, the direction of this response was dependent on whether BHB was added to the medium during the S. uberis challenge. Future studies should be conducted using bovine macrophages and in vivo approaches to examine BHB effects during an S. uberis challenge.;OBJECTIVE: Neointimal hyperplasia is the primary mechanism underlying atherosclerosis and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Ketogenic diet (KD) exerts beneficial effects in various diseases, but whether it could serve as non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KD on neointimal hyperplasia and the potential mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery balloon-injury model was employed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce neointimal hyperplasia. Then, animals were subjected to either standard rodent chow or KD. For in-vitro experiment, impacts of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the main mediator of KD effects, on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation were determined. Balloon injury induced event intimal hyperplasia and upregulation of protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and these changes were significantly ameliorated by KD. In addition, beta-HB could markedly inhibit PDGF-BB induced VMSC migration and proliferation, as well as inhibiting expressions of PCNA and alpha-SMC. Furthermore, KD inhibited balloon-injury induced oxidative stress in carotid artery, indicated by reduced ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We also found balloon-injury induced inflammation in carotid artery was suppressed by KD, indicated by decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: KD attenuates neointimal hyperplasia through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. KD may represent a promising non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia associated diseases.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;BACKGROUND: Ketone bodies are pleotropic metabolites that play important roles in multiple biological processes ranging from bioenergetics to inflammation regulation via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and epigenetic modifications. Ketone bodies are elevated in left ventricular failure (LVF) and multiple approaches that increase ketone concentrations exert advantageous cardiac effects in rodents and humans. However, the relationships between ketone bodies and right ventricular failure (RVF) are relatively unexplored. METHODS: 51 PAH patients were dichotomized into preserved or impaired RV function based on a cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m(2). Impaired RV function patients were further segmented into intermediate or severe RV dysfunction based on a right atrial pressure of 8 mm Hg. Serum ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) were quantified using ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In rodent studies, male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to three groups: control (saline injection), monocrotaline (MCT) standard chow diet (MCT-Standard), and MCT ketogenic diet (MCT-Keto). Immunoblots and confocal microscopy probed macrophage NLRP3 activation in RV extracts and sections. RV fibrosis was determined by Picrosirus Red. Echocardiography evaluated RV function. Pulmonary arteriole remodeling was assessed from histological specimens. RESULTS: Human RVF patients lacked a compensatory ketosis as serum AcAc and betaOHB levels were not associated with hemodynamic, echocardiographic, or biochemical measures of RV dysfunction. In rodent studies, AcAc and betaOHB levels were also not elevated in MCT-mediated RVF, but the ketogenic diet significantly increased AcAc and betaOHB levels. MCT-Keto exhibited suppressed NLRP3 activation with a reduction in NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein), pro-caspase-1, and interleukin-1 beta on immunoblots. Moreover, the number of ASC-positive macrophage in RV sections was reduced, RV fibrosis was blunted, and RV function was augmented in MCT-Keto rats. CONCLUSION: The ketogenic response is blunted in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with RVF. In the MCT rat model of PAH-mediated RVF, a dietary-induced ketosis improves RV function, suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and combats RV fibrosis. The summation of these data suggest ketogenic therapies may be particularly efficacious in RVF, and therefore future studies evaluating ketogenic interventions in human RVF are warranted.;Pre-clinical and cell culture evidence supports the role of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an immunomodulatory molecule that may inhibit inflammatory signalling involved in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies in humans are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time.;The ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to reduce anxiety and enhance cognitive functions in neurological diseases. However, the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers (Cd68, P2ry12) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex-specific decrease in IL1beta and an increase in IL-10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1beta, and cFos. Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL-10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1beta from human microglia in in-vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male-specific. Reduced pro-inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects.;The consequences of stroke include cognitive deficits and sensorimotor disturbances, which are largely related to mitochondrial impairments in the brain. In this work, we have shown that the mimetic of the ketogenic diet beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) can improve neurological brain function in stroke. At 3 weeks after photothrombotic stroke, mice receiving betaHB with drinking water before and after surgery recovered faster in terms of sensorimotor functions assessed by the string test and static rods and cognitive functions assessed by the Morris water maze. At the same time, the betaHB-treated mice had lower expression of some markers of astrocyte activation and inflammation (Gfap, Il-1b, Tnf). We hypothesize that long-term administration of betaHB promotes the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway, which leads to increased expression of antioxidant genes targeting mitochondria and genes involved in signaling pathways necessary for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity. betaHB partially maintained mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity during the first days after photothrombosis. However, in the following three weeks, the number of mtDNA damages increased in all experimental groups, which coincided with a decrease in Ogg1 expression, which plays an important role in mtDNA repair. Thus, we can assume that betaHB is not only an important metabolite that provides additional energy to brain tissue during recovery from stroke under conditions of mitochondrial damage but also an important signaling molecule that supports neuronal plasticity and reduces neuroinflammation.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.;Brain glucose deprivation is a component of the pathophysiology of ischemia, glucose transporter1 (GLUT1) deficiency, neurological disorders and occurs transiently in diabetes. Microglia, the neuroimmune cells must function effectively to offer immune defence and debris removal in low-energy settings. Brain glucose deprivation may compromise microglial functions further escalating the disease pathology and deteriorating the overall mental health. In the current study, HMC3 human microglia-like cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to glucose deprivation to investigate the effects of glucose deprivation on phenotypic state, redox status, secretion of cytokines and phagocytic capabilities of HMC3 cells. However, HMC3 cells were able to proliferate in the absence of glucose but showed signs of redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, as demonstrated by decreased MTT reduction and Mito Tracker staining of cells, along with a concomitant reduction in NOX2 protein, superoxide, and nitrite levels. Reduced levels of secreted TNF and IL-1beta were the signs of compromised cytokine secretion by glucose-deprived HMC3 microglia-like cells. Moreover, glucose-deprived HMC3 cells also showed reduced phagocytic activity as assessed by fluorescently labelled latex beads-based functional phagocytosis assay. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation restored the redox status, mitochondrial health, cytokine secretion, and phagocytic activity of glucose-deprived HMC3 microglia-like cells. Overall, impaired brain glucose metabolism may hinder microglia's capacity to release diffusible immune factors and perform phagocytosis. This could escalate the mental health issues in neurological diseases where brain glucose metabolism is compromised. Moreover, nutritional ketosis or exogenous ketone supplementation such as BHB may be utilized as a potential metabolic therapies for these conditions.;Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by disrupted immune function. Indeed, gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolomic profile alterations, are hallmarks of IBD. In this scenario, metabolite-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), involved in several biological processes, have emerged as pivotal players in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of this study was to characterize the axis microbiota-metabolite-GPCR in intestinal surgical resections from IBD patients. Results showed that UC patients had a lower microbiota richness and bacterial load, with a higher proportion of the genus Cellulosimicrobium and a reduced proportion of Escherichia, whereas CD patients showed a decreased abundance of Enterococcus. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in carboxylic acids, fatty acids, and amino acids in UC and CD samples. These patients also exhibited upregulated expression of most metabolite-sensing GPCRs analysed, which positively correlated with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers. The role of GPR109A was studied in depth and increased expression of this receptor was detected in epithelial cells and cells from lamina propria, including CD68+ macrophages, in IBD patients. The treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate increased gene expression of GPR109A, CD86, IL1B and NOS2 in U937-derived macrophages. Besides, when GPR109A was transiently silenced, the mRNA expression and secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were impaired in M1 macrophages. Finally, the secretome from siGPR109A M1 macrophages reduced the gene and protein expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 in intestinal fibroblasts. A better understanding of metabolite-sensing GPCRs, such as GPR109A, could establish their potential as therapeutic targets for managing IBD.;Arthropathy is a common complication in haemophilia and decreases quality of life. It has been known that concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in blood are increased by a ketogenic diet, and elevated levels of circulating BHB restricts the progression of inflammation-mediated joint pathological changes. We hypothesized that elevation of blood BHB concentrations could be effective for reducing the progression of bleeding-induced arthropathy by moderating the inflammatory responses of macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether BHB alleviates the arthropathy caused by repeated intra-articular blood injection in rats. To increase blood BHB levels, rats were fed with ketogenic diet. Repeated intra-articular blood injection induced significant joint swelling, whereas ketogenic diet intake significantly increased blood BHB concentrations and ameliorated the joint swelling. The periarticular tissue-fibrosis observed in the control diet intake group appeared to be significantly alleviated in the ketogenic diet intake group. In addition, the IL-1beta, which is involved in the progression of arthropathy, levels in the supernatants of blood-exposed macrophages derived from THP-1 cell line were significantly suppressed by BHB supplementation. In summary, BHB moderated the pathological joint changes caused by intra-articular blood exposure.;Ketone bodies, or ketones, are an alternative energy source and have several nonmetabolic signaling actions, such as inhibiting inflammation. Because of this, exogenous ketone supplementation has been used to help treat various diseases. beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) is the major ketone body that has reduced neurological injury and brain edema in animal models of ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury. However, the therapeutic potential of betaHB in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has not yet been determined. Here we investigated the effects of exogenous betaHB treatment following ICH on inflammation, edema, injury size, and functional outcomes. To do this, we administered 250 mg/kg of betaHB (subcutaneously every 12 hours) starting 2 hours after collagenase-induced ICH in rats over 3 experiments. First, we observed that betaHB-treated rats had significant reductions in transcript expression of pro-inflammatory markers Il1b (p = 0.0210), Tnfa (p = 0.0108), and Mcp1 (p = 0.0473) 3 days post-ICH. Second, betaHB significantly improved neurological deficits measured by the neurological deficit scale on day 3 (p = 0.0416) in another cohort of rats, despite no treatment effect on edema (p = 0.2110). To test whether the effects of acute betaHB treatment (for 7 days post-ICH) were chronically sustained, the third experiment used serial behavioural testing which confirmed that betaHB significantly improved neurological deficit scores (p = 0.0459) 3 days post-ICH. These effects were not sustained at 7, 14, and 28 days post-ICH (all p>/=0.1546). Similarly, betaHB treatment did not yield differences in forelimb use asymmetry (all p>0.45) or brain lesion volume (p = 0.3381), the primary endpoint of this study. Thus, our studies show that an acute betaHB treatment post-ICH can provide some early signs of functional benefit without evidence of lasting effects or neuroprotection. However, it remains to be tested whether other betaHB dosing regimens may favorably affect these and other neurological, behavioral, and biochemical parameters, particularly given the early signals of reduced striatal inflammation.;Ketotherapeutics is a potential metabolic intervention for mitigating dementias, however, its mechanisms and optimal methods of application are not well understood. Our previous in vitro study showed that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a major ketone body, reverses pathological features of amyloid-beta oligomer (AbetaO)-activated microglia. Here we tested the in vivo effects of BHB on microglia and synaptic plasticity in the 5xFAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. A short 1-week regimen of daily intraperitoneal injection of BHB (250 mg/kg), which induced brief and mild daily episodic ketosis, was sufficient to mitigate pro-inflammatory microglia activation and reduce brain amyloid-beta deposition by enhancing phagocytosis. Remarkably, it mitigated the deficits of hippocampal long-term depression but not long-term potentiation, and this effect was linked to suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-generated IL-1beta. As ketogenic diets are known for poor compliance, our study opens the possibility for alternative approaches such as short-term BHB injections or dietary ketone esters that are less restrictive, potentially safer, and easier for compliance.;Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for the majority of cases, is sturdily influenced by lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, obesity, and diabetes, leading to its classification as Type 3 diabetes. To model this pathological link, our AD-like model was developed by feeding Wistar male rats a high-fat diet with fructose in drinking water (HFFD) for 8 weeks, followed by a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This group was compared with a normal control group fed a standard diet and a beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-treated group (125 mg/kg, p.o.), administered starting 3 h after LPS and continuing for 1 week. The results demonstrate that BHB treatment illuminated cognitive gains, as indicated by the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1beta/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function."

Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time."
ENSG00000109471,IL2,0.70096475,weak,1,36170837,2022,Upper airway,The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate mitigates ILC2-driven airway inflammation by regulating mast cell function.,"Ketone bodies are increasingly understood to have regulatory effects on immune cell function, with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exerting a predominantly anti-inflammatory response. Dietary strategies to increase endogenous ketone body availability such as the ketogenic diet (KD) have recently been shown to alleviate inflammation of the respiratory tract. However, the role of BHB has not been addressed. Here, we observe that BHB suppresses group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)-mediated airway inflammation. Central to this are mast cells, which support ILC2 proliferation through interleukin-2 (IL-2). Suppression of the mast cell/IL-2 axis by BHB attenuates ILC2 proliferation and the ensuing type 2 cytokine response and immunopathology. Mechanistically, BHB directly inhibits mast cell function in part through GPR109A activation. Similar effects are achieved with either the KD or 1,3-butanediol. Our data reveal the protective role of BHB in ILC2-driven airway inflammation, which underscores the potential therapeutic value of ketone body supplementation for the management of asthma."

This study examined the hypothesis that ketosis increases the circulating levels of IL-6 in type 1 diabetic patients as well as the secretion of IL-6 in vitro in a cell culture model using U937 monocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting blood was obtained from type 1 diabetic patients and healthy siblings. To examine the effect of ketosis, U937 monocytes were cultured with ketone bodies (acetoacetate [AA], beta-hydroxybutyrate [BHB]) in the presence or absence of high glucose levels in the medium at 37 degrees C for 24 h. IL-6 was determined by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was detected using dihydroethidium dye. RESULTS: The blood level of IL-6 was higher in hyperketonemic (HK) diabetic patients than in normoketonemic (NK) diabetic patients (P < 0.05) and normal control subjects (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between ketosis and IL-6 levels (r = 0.36, P < 0.04, n = 34) in the blood of diabetic patients. Cell culture studies found that exogenous addition of the ketone body AA, but not BHB, increases IL-6 secretion and ROS generation in U937 cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented the IL-6 secretion in acetoacetate-treated U937 monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that hyperketonemia increases IL-6 levels in the blood of type 1 diabetic patients and that NAC can inhibit IL-6 secretion by U937 monocytic cells cultured in a ketotic medium.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;Ketogenic diets (KDs) are very high-fat low-carbohydrate diets that promote nutritional ketosis and are widely used for weight loss, although concerns about potential adverse cardiovascular effects remain. We investigated a very high-fat KD's vascular impact and plasma metabolic signature compared to a non-ketogenic high-fat diet (HFD). Apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE (-/-)) mice were fed a KD (%kcal:81:1:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein), a non-ketogenic high-fat diet with half of the fat content (HFD) (%kcal:40:42:18, fat/carbohydrate/protein) for 12 weeks. Plasma samples were used to quantify the major ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, and TNF alpha), and to targeted metabolomic profiling by mass spectrometry. In addition, aortic atherosclerotic lesions were quantified ex-vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a 14-tesla system. KD was atherogenic when compared to the control diet, but KD mice, when compared to the HFD group (1) had markedly higher levels of BHB and lower levels of cytokines, confirming the presence of ketosis that alleviated the well-established fat-induced systemic inflammation, (2) displayed significant changes in the plasma metabolome that included a decrease in lipophilic metabolites and an increase in hydrophilic metabolites, (3) had significantly lower levels of several atherogenic lipid metabolites, including phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides, and (4) presented significantly lower aortic plaque burden. KD was atherogenic and was associated with specific metabolic changes but alleviated the fat-induced inflammation and lessened the progression of atherosclerosis when compared to the HFD.;Pre-clinical and cell culture evidence supports the role of the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as an immunomodulatory molecule that may inhibit inflammatory signalling involved in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), but studies in humans are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in humans across three clinical trials. To investigate if BHB suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, we treated LPS-stimulated leukocytes from overnight-fasted adults at risk for T2D with BHB (Study 1). Next (Study 2), we investigated if exogenously raising BHB acutely in vivo by ketone monoester supplementation (KME) in adults with T2D would suppress pro-inflammatory plasma cytokines. In Study 3, we investigated the effect of BHB on inflammation via ex vivo treatment of LPS-stimulated leukocytes with BHB and in vivo thrice-daily pre-meal KME for 14 days in adults with T2D. Ex vivo treatment with BHB suppressed LPS-stimulated IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 secretion and increased IL-1RA and IL-10 (Study 1). Plasma IL-10 increased by 90 min following ingestion of a single dose of KME in T2D, which corresponded to peak blood BHB (Study 2). Finally, 14 days of thrice-daily KME ingestion did not significantly alter plasma cytokines or leukocyte subsets including monocyte and T-cell polarization (Study 3). However, direct treatment of leukocytes with BHB modulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1 secretion in a time- and glucose-dependent manner (Study 3). Therefore, BHB appears to be anti-inflammatory in T2D, but this effect is transient and is modulated by the presence of disease, glycaemia, and exposure time.;INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators have greatly improved outcomes in persons with CF (pwCF), however, there is still significant heterogeneity in clinical responses, particularly with regard to respiratory infection and inflammation. Exogenous administration of ketones has profound systemic anti-inflammatory effects and produces several nutrient-signaling and metabolic effects that may benefit multiple organ systems affected in pwCF. This pilot study was designed to determine the feasibility of administration of a ketone monoester (KME) to increase circulating D-beta hydroxybutyrate concentrations (D-betaHB) and to improve subjective measures of CF-specific quality of life and markers of inflammation in serum and sputum in adults with CF. METHODS: Fourteen participants receiving modulator therapy were randomized to receive either KME (n = 9) or placebo control (PC, n = 5) for 5-7 days during hospitalization for treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation or as outpatients under standard care. RESULTS: The KME was well tolerated, with only mild reports of gastrointestinal distress. D-betaHB concentrations increased from 0.2 +/- 0.1 mM to 1.6 +/- 0.6 mM in the KME group compared to 0.2 +/- 0.0 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 in the PC group (p = 0.011) within 15 min following consumption and remained elevated, relative to baseline, for over 2 h. Pulmonary function was not altered after single- or short-term KME administration, but participants in the KME group self-reported higher subjective respiratory scores compared to PC in both cases (p = 0.031). Plasma inflammatory markers were not statistically different between groups following the short-term (5-7 d) intervention (p > 0.05). However, an exploratory analysis of plasma pre- and post-IL-6 concentrations was significant (p = 0.028) in the KME group but not PC. Sputum IFNgamma (p = 0.057), IL-12p70 (p = 0.057), IL-1beta (p = 0.100), IL-15 (p = 0.057), IL-1alpha (p = 0.114), and MPO (p = 0.133) were lower in the KME group compared to PC but did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: With the emerging role of exogenous ketones as nutrient signaling molecules and mediators of metabolism, we showed that KME is well tolerated, increases circulating D-betaHB concentrations, and produces outcomes that justify the need for large-scale clinical trials to investigate the role of KME on whole-body and tissue lipid accumulation and inflammation in pwCF."

Food consumption and rat weight were recorded daily. Whole blood glucose concentrations were determined weekly. At sacrifice, liver, pancreas and epididymal fat pads were excised and blood samples were collected. Liver was analyzed for protein and lipid, pancreas was weighed and analyzed for insulin, fat pads were weighed and discarded, and blood was analyzed for glucose and lipid. The 13.5% BD diet increased the beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and cholesterol concentrations, decreased the glucose concentration in blood, and increased the insulin content of the pancreas. The BD diets did not affect the concentrations of phospholipid, triglyceride, cholesterol and fatty acid in the liver, fatty acid concentrations in the blood, or the epididymal fat pad weight. The results suggest that BD produced a slight amelioration of the diabetic condition, which may have resulted from an increased capacity of the pancreas to synthesize insulin. In addition, the data provide further evidence suggesting that in the rat BD is oxidized to the ketone bodies, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.;Since porcine islets are considered a likely tissue source for islet transplantation we have studied the insulin secretory responses to stimuli and some of the cell surface antigen characteristics of porcine islet cells. In a static incubation system, the threshold level of glucose required for the stimulation of insulin secretion from freshly isolated porcine islets was found to be between 2.8 and 4.2 mmol glucose/l. Arginine (5 mmol/l) and 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (1 mmol/l) potentiated insulin release induced by 8.3 mmol glucose/l. Leucine (5 mmol/l) initiated release in the presence of 2 mmol glucose/l. Neither beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/l) nor octanoate (5 mmol/l) potentiated insulin release induced by 8.3 mmol glucose/l, but beta-hydroxybutyrate initiated release in the presence of 2 mmol glucose/l while octanoate did not. A 125I-labelled protein A binding assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system were used to detect antibody binding to islet and non-islet cells. Monoclonal antibodies raised against intact rat islets were shown to bind to both porcine and rat islet cells but not to rat hepatoma tissue culture cells or rat insulinoma cells. The serum from recently diagnosed type I diabetics was shown to bind to rat islet cells in a 125I-labelled protein A binding assay, while serum from control subjects showed little, if any, binding. Porcine islet cells were unable to distinguish between the sera of recently diagnosed type I diabetics and controls in a similar assay. In conclusion, porcine islets respond to many of the major insulin secretagogues to which human islets are sensitive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);D-(-)-beta-Hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate cause a rapid, sustained, and rapidly reversible stimulation of insulin release from rat pancreatic islets incubated in the presence, but not absence, of D-glucose. This coincides with stimulation of both proinsulin biosynthesis and 45Ca net uptake. The ketone bodies also decrease 45Ca outflow from prelabeled islets perifused in the absence of Ca2+ and, in contrast, enhance effluent radioactivity in the presence of Ca2+. In the presence of D-glucose, the secretory response to D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate is concentration related in the 2.5-20 mM range, abolished in the absence of Ca2+ or presence of KCN, and enhanced by theophylline and forskolin. It corresponds grossly to a shift to the left of the sigmoidal curve relating insulin output to the ambient concentration of D-glucose. The secretory, biosynthetic, and cationic response to acetoacetate is less marked than that evoked by an equimolar concentration of D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate. These features are compatible with the view that the insulinotropic action of ketone bodies would be causally linked to their metabolism in islet cells.;The metabolism of ketone bodies was investigated in rat pancreatic islets incubated in the absence or presence of D-glucose. The generation of 14CO2 from 3-14C-labeled ketone bodies, the interconversion of D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (AcAc), the reciprocal effects of ketone bodies and D-glucose on their respective catabolism, and the influence of these exogenous nutrients on the output of 14CO2 from islets preincubated with either L-[U-14C]glutamine or [U-14C]palmitate provided an estimation of the nutrient-induced changes in O2 uptake that was in fair agreement with the observed modifications of islet respiration. There was a close correlation between such changes and the corresponding values for insulin output. Because the stimulation of insulin release by ketone bodies also coincided with a decrease in 86Rb outflow from prelabeled islets, these findings suggest that the insulinotropic action of ketone bodies is causally linked to their catabolism through an increase in ATP generation rate and a subsequent decrease in K+ conductance. A complementary participation of changes in mitochondrial redox state to stimulus-secretion coupling is considered, however, in the light of comparisons between the effects of D-(-)-beta-hydroxybutyrate and AcAc, respectively, on mitochondrial NADH generation, 45Ca net uptake, and D-[6-14C]glucose oxidation.;To elucidate the physiological significance of ketone bodies on insulin and glucagon secretion, the direct effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) infusion on insulin and glucagon release from perfused rat pancreas were investigated. The BOHB or AcAc was administered at concentrations of 10, 1, or 0.1 mM for 30 min at 4.0 ml/min. High-concentration infusions of BOHB and AcAc (10 mM) produced significant increases in insulin release in the presence of 4.4 mM glucose, but low-concentration infusions of BOHB and AcAc (1 and 0.1 mM) caused no significant changes in insulin secretion from perfused rat pancreas. BOHB (10, 1, and 0.1 mM) and AcAc (10 and 1 mM) infusion significantly inhibited glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas. These results suggest that physiological concentrations of ketone bodies have no direct effect on insulin release but have a direct inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from perfused rat pancreas.;In normal suckling-weanling mice, DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (30 mmol/kg ip) stimulated insulin secretion and reduced plasma glucose levels. In the brains of these animals, glucose levels were tripled due to a reduced rate of glucose utilization (determined by deoxyglucose phosphorylation). Other metabolite changes were compatible with inhibition of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-P-dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities. In contrast to the decrease in cerebral glycolysis, metabolite changes were compatible with an increase in the Krebs citric acid metabolic flux. The brain energy charge was also elevated. While it is generally believed that ketone bodies cannot sustain normal brain metabolism and function in the absence of glucose, DL-beta-hydroxybutyrate (20 or 30 mmol/kg ip) reversed insulin (100 U/kg sc)-induced hypoglycemia despite the persistence of a critically reduced plasma glucose concentration and near-zero brain glucose levels. Metabolic correlates of possible significance in the behavioral recovery from coma were reductions of the elevated levels of brain aspartate to below normal and ammonia levels to normal. Levels of acetyl CoA were unchanged both before and after treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate.;We previously demonstrated in the rat that long term exposure to fatty acids inhibits B-cell function in vivo and in vitro. To further assess the clinical significance of these findings, we tested in human islets the effects of fatty acids on glucose-induced insulin release and biosynthesis and on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Human islets were obtained from the beta-Cell Transplant Unit (Brussels, Belgium). Exposure to 0.125 mmol/L palmitate or oleate for 48 h during tissue culture (RPMI-1640 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose) inhibited the postculture insulin response to 27 mmol/L glucose by 40% and 42% (P < 0.01 for difference). Inhibition was partly prevented by coculture with 1 mumol/L etomoxir, a carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-I inhibitor (P < 0.05 for effect of etomoxir). Inhibitory effects on glucose-induced insulin secretion by previous palmitate were additive to the inhibitory effects exerted by previous high glucose (11 and 27 mmol/L). Palmitate-induced inhibition of insulin secretion was evident after exposure to 25 mumol/L added fatty acid. The insulin content of islets exposed to fatty acids was significantly reduced, and glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis was inhibited by 59% after palmitate addition and by 51% after oleate exposure (P < 0.01). These effects were partly prevented by etomoxir (P < 0.05). The activity of PDH in mitochondrial extracts of islets preexposed for 48 h to palmitate was decreased by 35% (P < 0.05) vs. that in control islets, whereas the activity of PDH kinase (which inactivates PDH) was significantly increased in the same preparations (P < 0.05). The effects of ketones were tested by 48-h exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-D-OHB). Ten millimoles of D-beta-OHB per L inhibited the subsequently tested insulin response to 27 mmol/L glucose by 56% (P < 0.001). Half-maximal inhibitory effects of D-beta-OHB on insulin secretion and insulin content were seen at concentrations between 0.5-2.5 mmol/L. Inhibition by D-beta-OHB was partially reversed by etomoxir, whereas exposure to D-beta-OHB failed to affect PDH and PDH kinase activities. We conclude that fatty acids as well as ketone bodies diminish B-cell responsiveness to glucose in human islets by way of a glucose-fatty acid cycle. Increased plasma concentrations of fatty acids and ketones are likely to be important factors behind the negative influences on B-cell function exerted by a diabetic state in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.;Though the pig appears to be the islet donor of choice for grafts in diabetic patients, there may be a risk of transmission of infectious agents. In this context, we adopted a strategy of islet isolation from pigs raised and killed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions as a minimum with regard to the concept of quality assurance. Accordingly, the present study investigated the function of SPF pig islets to determine whether they react qualitatively and quantitatively to nutriments, hormones and neuromediators with which they would be confronted in man and could therefore provide effective regulation during physiologic or physiopathologic situations. beta cells from 18 Large-White SPF pigs were functionally intact after 7 days in culture. Insulin stimulation indexes (SI) of 3.1 +/- 0.2, 2.2 +/- 0.1, and 4.4 +/- 0.3 were found respectively for 30 mmol/l K+, 100 mumol/l tolbutamide and 10 mmol/l theophylline. Basal insulin secretion (72.2 +/- 7.6 muU/min) had already increased significantly (p < 0.001) with 5.5 mmol/l glucose (184.2 +/- 25.5 muU/min, SI: 2.5 +/- 0.6), indicating that the threshold stimulatory concentration was comparable to that of human islets. Insulin secretion increased in a glucose dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001): SI: 3.1 +/- 0.3 and 3.6 +/- 0.2 with 11.0 mmol/l and 22.0 mmol/l glucose, which showed a satisfactory magnitude with reference to human islets. Even the subtle phenomenon of ""glucose memory"" was apparent in these pig islets. Arginine stimulated (p < 0.001) insulin secretion dose-dependently (SI: 2.2 +/- 0.3 with 5 mmol/l and 2.9 +/- 0.2 with 10 mmol/l). The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mmol/l) also induced insulin secretion (SI: 4.3 +/- 0.3). Insulin release was stimulated by 4 mumol/l gastric inhibitory peptide, revealing sensitivity to the hormonal enteroinsular axis, and by 2 mumol/l glucagon. Parasympathetic cholinergic influence was studied using 500 mumol/l carbamylcholine, which increased insulin secretion. The influence of orthosympathetic control and of stress situations was also studied. As in human islet response, epinephrine and the alpha 2-agonist clonidine (50 mumol/l) inhibited insulin secretion. Finally pre-culture of islets may be beneficial for graft outcome, provided that no deterioration in islet function occurs. A prolonged 21-day culture of SPF pig islets showed no decrease in insulin response to glucose, arginine and potassium, even with an unaltered threshold stimulatory glucose concentration. Thus, Large-White SPF pigs and the application of our isolation procedure provided islets with functional characteristics reproducibly compatible with potential utilisation for effective regulation of glycaemia under physiologic and physiopathologic situations in humans.;The objective of this study was to assess the role of free fatty acids (FFAs) as insulin secretagogues in patients with type 2 diabetes. To this end, basal insulin secretion rates (ISR) in response to acute increases in plasma FFAs were evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes and in age- and weight-matched nondiabetic control subjects during 1) intravenous infusion of lipid plus heparin (L/H), which stimulated intravascular lipolysis, and 2) the FFA rebound, which followed lowering of plasma FFAs with nicotinic acid (NA) and was a consequence of increased lipolysis from the subject's own adipose tissue. At comparable euglycemia, diabetic patients had similar ISR but higher plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) levels during L/H infusion and higher plasma FFA and beta-OHB levels during the FFA rebound than nondiabetic control subjects. Correlating ISR with plasma FFA plus beta-OHB levels showed that in response to the same changes in FFA plus beta-OHB levels, diabetic patients secreted approximately 30% less insulin than nondiabetic control subjects. In addition, twice as much insulin was secreted during L/H infusion as during the FFA rebound in response to the same FFA/beta-OHB stimulation by both diabetic patients and control subjects. Glycerol, which was present in the infused lipid (272 mmol/l) did not affect ISR. We concluded that 1) assessment of FFA effects on ISR requires consideration of effects on ISR by ketone bodies, 2) ISR responses to FFA/beta-OHB were defective in patients with type 2 diabetes (partial beta-cell lipid blindness), but this defect was compensated by elevated plasma levels of FFAs and ketone bodies, and 3) approximately two times more insulin was released per unit change in plasma FFA plus beta-OHB during L/H infusion than during the FFA rebound after NA. The reason for this remains to be explored.;To investigate the effects of chronic exposure to ketone bodies on glucose-induced insulin secretion, we evaluated insulin release, intracellular Ca2+ and metabolism, and Ca2+ efficacy of the exocytotic system in rat pancreatic islets. Fifteen-hour exposure to 5 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (HB) reduced high glucose-induced insulin secretion and augmented basal insulin secretion. Augmentation of basal release was derived from promoting the Ca2+-independent and ATP-independent component of insulin release, which was suppressed by the GDP analog. Chronic exposure to HB affected mostly the second phase of glucose-induced biphasic secretion. Dynamic experiments showed that insulin release and NAD(P)H fluorescence were lower, although the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) was not affected 10 min after exposure to high glucose. Additionally, [Ca2+](i) efficacy in exocytotic system at clamped concentrations of ATP was not affected. NADH content, ATP content, and ATP-to-ADP ratio in the HB-cultured islets in the presence of high glucose were lower, whereas glucose utilization and oxidation were not affected. Mitochondrial ATP production shows that the respiratory chain downstream of complex II is not affected by chronic exposure to HB, and that the decrease in ATP production is due to decreased NADH content in the mitochondrial matrix. Chronic exposure to HB suppresses glucose-induced insulin secretion by lowering the ATP level, at least partly by inhibiting ATP production by reducing the supply of NADH to the respiratory chain. Glucose-induced insulin release in the presence of aminooxyacetate was not reduced, which implies that chronic exposure to HB affects the malate/aspartate shuttle and thus reduces NADH supply to mitochondria.;Mitochondrial anaplerosis is important for insulin secretion, but only some of the products of anaplerosis are known. We discovered novel effects of mitochondrial metabolites on insulin release in INS-1 832/13 cells that suggested pathways to some of these products. Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), and monomethyl succinate (MMS) alone did not stimulate insulin release. Lactate released very little insulin. When acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, or KIC were combined with MMS, or either ketone body was combined with lactate, insulin release was stimulated 10-fold to 20-fold the controls (almost as much as with glucose). Pyruvate was a potent stimulus of insulin release. In rat pancreatic islets, beta-hydroxybutyrate potentiated MMS- and glucose-induced insulin release. The pathways of their metabolism suggest that, in addition to producing ATP, the ketone bodies and KIC supply the acetate component and MMS supplies the oxaloacetate component of citrate. In line with this, citrate was increased by beta-hydroxybutyrate plus MMS in INS-1 cells and by beta-hydroxybutyrate plus succinate in mitochondria. The two ketone bodies and KIC can also be metabolized to acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which are precursors of other short-chain acyl-CoAs (SC-CoAs). Measurements of SC-CoAs by LC-MS/MS in INS-1 cells confirmed that KIC, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and pyruvate increased the levels of acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA. MMS increased incorporation of (14)C from beta-hydroxybutyrate into citrate, acid-precipitable material, and lipids, suggesting that the two molecules complement one another to increase anaplerosis. The results suggest that, besides citrate, some of the products of anaplerosis are SC-CoAs, which may be precursors of molecules involved in insulin secretion.;We hypothesized that contrasting leucine with its non-metabolizable analog 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) might provide new information about metabolic pathways involved in insulin secretion. Both compounds stimulate insulin secretion by allosterically activating glutamate dehydrogenase, which enhances glutamate metabolism. However, we found that leucine was a stronger secretagogue in rat pancreatic islets and INS-1 cells. This suggested that leucine's metabolism contributed to its insulinotropism. Indeed, we found that leucine increased acetoacetate and was metabolized to CO(2) in pancreatic islets and increased short chain acyl-CoAs (SC-CoAs) in INS-1 cells. We then used the leucine-BCH difference to study the hypothesis that acyl groups derived from secretagogue carbon can be transferred as acetoacetate, in addition to citrate, from mitochondria to the cytosol where they can be converted to SC-CoAs. Since BCH cannot form sufficient acetoacetate from glutamate, transport of any glutamate-derived acyl groups to the cytosol in BCH-stimulated cells must proceed mainly via citrate. In ATP citrate lyase-deficient INS-1 cells, which are unable to convert citrate into cytosolic acetyl-CoA, insulin release by BCH was decreased and adding beta-hydroxybutyrate or alpha-ketoisocaproate, which increases mitochondrial acetoacetate, normalized BCH-induced insulin release. This strengthens the concept that acetoacetate-transferred acyl carbon can be converted to cytosolic SC-CoAs to stimulate insulin secretion.;Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of coenzyme-A from acetoacetyl-CoA to succinate to form acetoacetate and succinyl-CoA. mRNAs of SCOT and ATP citrate lyase were decreased 55% and 58% and enzyme activities were decreased >70% in pancreatic islets of the GK rat, a model of type 2 diabetes. INS-1 832/13 cells were transfected with shRNAs targeting SCOT mRNA to generate cell lines with reduced SCOT activity. Two cell lines with >70% knockdown of SCOT activity showed >70% reduction in glucose- or methyl succinate-plus-beta-hydroxybutyrate-stimulated insulin release. Less inhibition of insulin release was observed with two cell lines with less knockdown of SCOT. Previous studies showed knockdown of ATP citrate lyase in INS-1 832/13 cells does not lower insulin release. The results further support work that suggests mitochondrial pathways involving SCOT which supply acetoacetate for export to the cytosol are important for insulin secretion.;Anaplerosis, the net synthesis in mitochondria of citric acid cycle intermediates, and cataplerosis, their export to the cytosol, have been shown to be important for insulin secretion in rodent beta cells. However, human islets may be different. We observed that the enzyme activity, protein level, and relative mRNA level of the key anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) were 80-90% lower in human pancreatic islets compared with islets of rats and mice and the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 832/13. Activity and protein of ATP citrate lyase, which uses anaplerotic products in the cytosol, were 60-75% lower in human islets than in rodent islets or the cell line. In line with the lower PC, the percentage of glucose-derived pyruvate that entered mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation in human islets was only 20-30% that in rat islets. This suggests human islets depend less on pyruvate carboxylation than rodent models that were used to establish the role of PC in insulin secretion. Human islets possessed high levels of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase, an enzyme that forms acetoacetate in the mitochondria, and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, which uses acetoacetate to form acyl-CoAs in the cytosol. Glucose-stimulated human islets released insulin similarly to rat islets but formed much more acetoacetate. beta-Hydroxybutyrate augmented insulin secretion in human islets. This information supports previous data that indicate beta cells can use a pathway involving succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase to synthesize and use acetoacetate and suggests human islets may use this pathway more than PC and citrate to form cytosolic acyl-CoAs.;OBJECTIVE: The ketones d-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate are elevated during prolonged fasting or during a ""ketogenic"" diet. Although weight loss on a ketogenic diet may be associated with decreased appetite and altered gut hormone levels, it is unknown whether such changes are caused by elevated blood ketones. This study investigated the effects of an exogenous ketone ester (KE) on appetite. METHODS: Following an overnight fast, subjects with normal weight (n = 15) consumed 1.9 kcal/kg of KE, or isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), in drinks matched for volume, taste, tonicity, and color. Blood samples were analyzed for BHB, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and a three-measure visual analogue scale was used to measure hunger, fullness, and desire to eat. RESULTS: KE consumption increased blood BHB levels from 0.2 to 3.3 mM after 60 minutes. DEXT consumption increased plasma glucose levels between 30 and 60 minutes. Postprandial plasma insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels were significantly lower 2 to 4 hours after KE consumption, compared with DEXT consumption. Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with consumption of DEXT. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood ketone levels may directly suppress appetite, as KE drinks lowered plasma ghrelin levels, perceived hunger, and desire to eat.;AIMS/INTRODUCTION: As a low-carbohydrate diet and the use of sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors are both known to increase D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, the effect of these levels on glucose metabolism has attracted attention. We investigated the acute effects of ketone monoester (KM) ingestion on blood glucose levels during the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in participants with impaired glucose tolerance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine Japanese adults aged 48-62 years (4 men, 5 women) with impaired glucose tolerance participated in this study. After participants fasted overnight, we carried out OGTT for 180 min with and without KM ingestion on two separate days in a randomized cross-over design. We compared the area under the curve (AUC) of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and free fatty acids during OGTT. RESULTS: The AUC of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate during OGTT was significantly higher with KM than without KM (KM 5995.3 +/- 1257.1 mmol/L.h, without KM 116.1 +/- 33.9 mmol/L.h, P < 0.0001), and the AUC of glucose with KM was significantly lower than that without KM (KM 406.6 +/- 70.6 mg/dL.h, without KM 483.2 +/- 74.3 mg/dL.h, P < 0.0001). This improved glucose excursion was associated with enhanced AUC of insulin during the first half (0-90 min) of OGTT, even though the AUC of C-peptide during this period was unchanged. In contrast, the AUC of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and free fatty acids during 180 min of OGTT were similar in both conditions. CONCLUSION: The ingestion of KM decreased the AUC of glucose during 75-g OGTT in Japanese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, and the mechanism might involve elevated levels of circulating early phase insulin.;During periods of prolonged fasting/starvation, the liver generates ketones [i.e., beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB)] that primarily serve as alternative substrates for ATP production. Previous studies have demonstrated that elevations in skeletal muscle ketone oxidation contribute to obesity-related hyperglycemia, whereas inhibition of succinyl CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT), the rate-limiting enzyme of ketone oxidation, can alleviate obesity-related hyperglycemia. As circulating ketone levels are a key determinant of ketone oxidation rates, we tested the hypothesis that increases in circulating ketone levels would worsen glucose homeostasis secondary to increases in muscle ketone oxidation. Accordingly, male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to high-fat diet-induced obesity, whereas their lean counterparts received a standard chow diet. Lean and obese mice were orally administered either a ketone ester (KE) or placebo, followed by a glucose tolerance test. In tandem, we conducted isolated islet perifusion experiments to quantify insulin secretion in response to ketones. We observed that exogenous KE administration robustly increases circulating betaOHB levels, which was associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance only in obese mice. These observations were independent of muscle ketone oxidation, as they were replicated in mice with a skeletal muscle-specific SCOT deficiency. Furthermore, the R-isomer of betaOHB produced greater increases in perifusion insulin levels versus the S-isomer in isolated islets from obese mice. Taken together, acute elevations in circulating ketones promote glucose-lowering in obesity. Given that only the R-isomer of betaOHB is oxidized, further studies are warranted to delineate the precise role of beta-cell ketone oxidation in regulating insulin secretion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY It has been demonstrated that increased skeletal muscle ketone metabolism contributes to obesity-related hyperglycemia. Since increases in ketone supply are key determinants of organ ketone oxidation rates, we determined whether acute elevations in circulating ketones following administration of an oral ketone ester may worsen glucose homeostasis in lean or obese mice. Our work demonstrates the opposite, as acute elevations in circulating ketones improved glucose tolerance in obese mice.;This study examined the effect of exogenous ketone bodies (KB) on oxygen consumption (V̇o(2)), carbon dioxide production (V̇co(2)), and glucose metabolism. The data were compared with the effects of endogenous ketonemia during both, a ketogenic diet or fasting. Eight healthy individuals [24.1 +/- 2.5 yr, body mass index (BMI) 24.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m(2)] participated in a crossover intervention study and were studied in a whole-room indirect calorimeter (WRIC) to assess macronutrient oxidation following four 24-h interventions: isocaloric controlled mixed diet (ISO), ISO supplemented with ketone salts (38.7 g of beta-hydroxybutyrate/day, EXO), isocaloric ketogenic diet (KETO), and total fasting (FAST). A physical activity level of 1.65 was obtained. In addition to plasma KB, 24-h C-peptide and KB excretion rates in the urine and postprandial glucose and insulin levels were measured. Although 24-h KB excretion increased in response to KETO and FAST, there was a modest increase in response to EXO only (P < 0.05). When compared with ISO, V̇o(2) significantly increased in KETO (P < 0.01) and EXO (P < 0.001), whereas there was no difference in FAST. V̇co(2) increased in EXO but decreased in KETO (both P < 0.01) and FAST (P < 0.001), resulting in 24-h respiratory exchange ratios (RER) of 0.828 +/- 0.024 (ISO) and 0.811 +/- 0.024 (EXO) (P < 0.05). In response to EXO there were no differences in basal and postprandial glucose and insulin levels, as well as in insulin sensitivity. When compared with ISO, EXO, and KETO, FAST increased homeostatic model assessment beta-cell function (HOMA-B) (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, at energy balance exogenous ketone salts decreased respiratory exchange ratio without affecting glucose tolerance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our findings revealed that during isocaloric nutrition, additional exogenous ketone salts increased V̇o(2) and V̇co(2) while lowering the respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Ketone salts had no effect on postprandial glucose metabolism.;Dietary carbohydrates raise blood glucose levels, and limiting carbohydrate intake improves glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Low carbohydrate intake (< 25 g) allows the body to utilize fat as its primary fuel. As a consequence of increased fatty acid oxidation, the liver produces ketones to serve as an alternative energy source. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) is the most abundant ketone. While betaHB has a wide range of functions outside of the pancreas, its direct effects on islet cell function remain understudied. We examined human islet secretory response to acute racemic betaHB treatment and observed increased insulin secretion at a low glucose concentration of 3 mM. Because betaHB is a chiral molecule, existing as both R and S forms, we further studied insulin and glucagon secretion following acute treatment with individual betaHB enantiomers in human and C57BL/6J mouse islets. We found that acute treatment with R-betaHB increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion at physiological glucose concentrations in both human and mouse islets. Proteomic analysis of human islets treated with R-betaHB over 72 hours showed altered abundance of proteins that may promote islet cell health and survival. Collectively, our data show that physiological concentrations of betaHB influence hormone secretion and signaling within pancreatic islets.;The heart and kidney have a high energy requirement, but relatively little is known about their utilization of ketones as a potential energy source. We assessed the metabolism of the ketone tracer, carbon-11 acetoacetate ((11)C-AcAc), by the left and right ventricles of the heart and by the kidney using positron emission tomography (PET) in n = 10 healthy adults under four experimental conditions: a 4-h fast (fasted) +/- a single 12 g oral dose of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), and a single complete, liquid replacement meal (hereafter referred to as the ""fed"" condition) +/- a single 12 g oral dose of D-BHB. Under these experimental conditions, the kinetics of (11)C-AcAc metabolism fitted a two-compartment model in the heart and a three-compartment model in the kidney. Plasma ketones were about 10-fold higher with the oral dose of D-BHB. During the four conditions, tracer kinetics were broadly similar in the myocardium and kidney cortex. (11)C-AcAc metabolism by the kidney pelvis was similar in three of the four study conditions but, later, peaked significantly higher than that in the cortex, the exception was that the tracer uptake was significantly lower in the fed condition without D-BHB. (11)C-AcAc uptake was significantly inversely correlated with age in the kidney cortex, and its oxidative metabolism was significantly positively correlated with age in the left ventricle. D-BHB blunted the insulin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and C-peptide response to the meal. This PET methodology and these acute metabolic perturbations would be suitable for future studies assessing cardiorenal ketone metabolism in conditions in which heart and kidney functions are experimentally modified or compromised by disease."

Compared with control incubations at pH 7.4, binding was reduced by 19 per cent at pH 7.1 and by 48 per cent at pH 6.8. Addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate, at concentrations similar to those seen clinically, ""restored"" insulin binding toward normal. We suggest that, by counteracting the effects of acidosis, ketoacids themselves maintain normal insulin-receptor binding in diabetic ketoacidosis. These data also illustrate that small molecules, present in vivo, can significantly alter the interactions between a hormone and its receptor in vitro.;The etiology of insulin resistance during diabetic ketoacidosis is still poorly understood. Changes in insulin receptor binding and the existence of postreceptor alterations have been proposed. In an attempt to clarify the role of low pH and ketone bodies in the insulin resistance, we examined the effectiveness of insulin during and after 48 h of exposure of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes to low pH and ketoacids. In the ""acute"" stage, lowering of physiologic pH (pH 7.4) to pH 6.9 induced a decrease in insulin binding (50%), which was due to a decrease in the rate of association. Concomitantly, the insulin sensitivity was decreased (ninefold). The basal hexose uptake and insulin responsiveness were only slightly decreased at low pH. Beta-hydroxybutyrate partially counteracted the effect of low pH on insulin binding and sensitivity in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50: 10 mM). The binding-enhancing effect of ketoacids was more pronounced at low pH than at physiologic pH and absent at optimum pH (pH 8.0). After 48 h of exposure of the cells to pH 6.9, insulin binding and insulin sensitivity (measured at physiologic pH) were similar as in cells cultured at pH 7.4. The insulin response, however, was substantially impaired (40%), due to an increase in basal hexose uptake as well as a decrease in maximal insulin-stimulated uptake. These postbinding alterations induced by low pH could be reversed by culturing the cells at physiologic pH for another 48 h. Prolonged exposure to ketoacids did not affect the insulin effectiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We have already shown that chronic exposure to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) decreases insulin-mediated activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. To gain further insights into the mechanism underlying ketone body-induced insulin resistance, we examined whether OHB alters activation of the insulin-signaling cascade and whether the insulinomimetic agent vanadate could bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in these cells. Cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5 mM OHB, 50 microM vanadate or both for 16 h before the measurement of glucose uptake or the activation of insulin-signaling molecules. While chronic exposure to OHB did not alter insulin- or vanadate-mediated activation of the insulin receptor, it suppressed insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation in response to both agonists. Furthermore, this treatment decreased by 54 and 36% the phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and PKB in response to insulin, whereas it did not alter vanadate-mediated activation of these enzymes. Although insulin did not significantly stimulate p38MAPK phosphorylation, vanadate increased it by 3.8-fold. Furthermore, chronic exposure to OHB potentiated vanadate's action, resulting in a 250% increase in enzyme activation compared to control cells. Though OHB induced a 2.1-fold increase of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, inhibition of this enzyme with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 demonstrated that ERK1/2 did not participate in OHB-induced insulin resistance. In conclusion, ketone bodies promote insulin resistance probably through decreased activation of the PI3-K/PKB signaling cascade. Furthermore, vanadate can bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in OHB-treated cardiomyocytes."

Ketones may work through the brain, therefore, we evaluated whether the intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrates would also modulate peripheral energy and glucose homeostasis, and through what mechanisms, in diabetic rats fed a high fat diet in short- and long-term studies. Short-term (3h) central injection of BHB (50 mug/h) improved serum glucose levels and peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) group among 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats, but not in non-diabetic Sham rats. In addition to short-term infusion, long-term (28 days) central infusion of BHB (12 mug/h) elevated serum BHB levels. Long-term infusion of BHB potentiated leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus to slightly decrease body weight in Px rats. Central BHB infusion had a greater effect on peripheral glucose metabolism than overall energy metabolism. Hepatic insulin signaling (tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2-->serine phosphorylation of Akt-->reduced expression of PEPCK) was potentiated and hepatic glucose production in the hyperinsulinemic state was suppressed in the diabetic rats. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved by central BHB infusion through enhanced whole body glucose disposal rates, but insulin secretion was not affected in the diabetic rats. In conclusion, mild ketosis by central infusion of ketones improves energy and glucose metabolism through the potentiation of leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats."
ENSG00000177606,JUN,0.5444076,weak,1,36533180,2022,Brain/CNS,"Effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate on behavioral alterations, molecular and morphological changes in CNS of multiple sclerosis mouse model.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

KCNQ2-5 subunits each harbor a high-affinity anticonvulsant drug-binding pocket containing an essential tryptophan (W265 in human KCNQ3) conserved for >500 million years, yet lacking a known physiological function. Here, phylogenetic analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, in silico docking, electrophysiology, and radioligand binding assays reveal that the anticonvulsant binding pocket evolved to accommodate endogenous neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which directly activates KCNQ5 and KCNQ3 via W265. GABA, and endogenous metabolites beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), competitively and differentially shift the voltage dependence of KCNQ3 activation. Our results uncover a novel paradigm: direct neurotransmitter activation of voltage-gated ion channels, enabling chemosensing of the neurotransmitter/metabolite landscape to regulate channel activity and cellular excitability.;Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, paralogous genes encoding Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 voltage-gated K(+) channel subunits, are responsible for early-onset developmental/epileptic disorders characterized by heterogeneous clinical phenotypes ranging from benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) to early-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). KCNQ2 variants account for the majority of pedigrees with BFNE and KCNQ3 variants are responsible for a much smaller subgroup, but the reasons for this imbalance remain unclear. Analysis of additional pedigrees is needed to further clarify the nature of this genetic heterogeneity and to improve prediction of pathogenicity for novel variants. We identified a BFNE family with two siblings and a parent affected. Exome sequencing on samples from both parents and siblings revealed a novel KCNQ3 variant (c.719T>G, p.M240R), segregating in the three affected individuals. The M240 residue is conserved among human Kv7.2-5 and lies between the two arginines (R5 and R6) closest to the intracellular side of the voltage-sensing S(4) transmembrane segment. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells revealed that homomeric Kv7.3 M240R channels were not functional, whereas heteromeric channels incorporating Kv7.3 M240R mutant subunits with Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 displayed a depolarizing shift of about 10 mV in activation gating. Molecular modeling results suggested that the M240R substitution preferentially stabilized the resting state and possibly destabilized the activated state of the Kv7.3 subunits, a result consistent with functional data. Exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body generated during the ketogenic diet (KD), reversed channel dysfunction induced by the M240R variant. In conclusion, we describe the first missense loss-of-function (LoF) pathogenic variant within the S(4) segment of Kv7.3 identified in patients with BFNE. Studied under conditions mimicking heterozygosity, the M240R variant mainly affects the voltage sensitivity, in contrast to previously analyzed BFNE Kv7.3 variants that reduce current density. Our pharmacological results provide a rationale for the use of KD in patients carrying LoF variants in Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 subunits.;Mutations within the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 genes are well described causes for genetic childhood epilepsies. Knowledge on these channels in acquired focal epilepsy, especially in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), however, is scarce. Here, we used the rat pilocarpine model of drug-resistant mTLE to elucidate both expression and function by quantitative polymerase-chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology, respectively. We found transcriptional downregulation of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 as well as reduced Kv7.2 expression in epileptic CA1. Consequences were altered synaptic transmission, hyperexcitability which consisted of epileptiform afterpotentials, and increased susceptibility to acute GABAergic disinhibition. Importantly, blocking Kv7 channels with XE991 increased hyperexcitability in control tissue, but not in chronically epileptic tissue suggesting that the Kv7 deficit had precluded XE991 effects in this tissue. Conversely, XE991 resulted in comparable reduction of the paired-pulse ratio in both experimental groups implying preserved presynaptic Kv7.2 function of Schaffer collateral terminals. Consistent with Kv7.2/7.3 downregulation, the Kv7.3 channel opener beta-hydroxybutyrate failed to mitigate hyperexcitability. Our findings demonstrate that compromised Kv7 function is not only relevant in genetic epilepsy, but also in acquired focal epilepsy. Moreover, they help explain reduced anti-seizure efficacy of Kv7 channel openers in drug-resistant epilepsy."

The anticonvulsant mechanisms of KD have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study explored whether a KD could exert antioxidative effects by altering brain Klotho (Kl) gene expression.Methods: Thirty male rats were divided into three groups: the normal diet (ND) group received standard rat chow, the calorie-restricted diet (CRD) group was maintained at 90% of the calculated energy need, and the KD group received a diet composed of 8% protein, 2% carbohydrates, and 90% fat (per calorie macronutrient). The levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the serum, Kl gene expression in the brain, and Kl protein, malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl (PC) levels in the serum and brain were evaluated by standard methods.Results: The serum BHB levels in the KD group were significantly greater than those in the ND and CRD groups (p < 0.001). The Kl expression in the brain was significantly greater in the KD group than in the ND group (p = 0.028). The brain MDA levels in the KD group were significantly lower than those in the ND group (p = 0.006). Elevated BHB was positively correlated with brain Kl expression (r = 0.668, p < 0.001). The brain MDA levels were negatively correlated with brain Kl expression (r = -0.531, p = 0.003) and serum BHB levels (r = 0.472, p = 0.020).Discussion: KD might exert antioxidative effects by increasing BHB and upregulating Kl in the brain. This could be considered a possible anticonvulsant mechanism of KD."

Male adult mice were exposed to 30 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously 5 min before reperfusion for continuous delivery of the exogenous BHB (1.6 mmol/kg/24 h). Treatment with BHB reduced infarct size and levels of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum, attenuated apoptosis in myocardium, and preserved cardiac function of I/R mice. Importantly, treatment of I/R mice with BHB promoted autophagic flux, evidenced by reduced the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and protein expression of p62 and enhanced protein expression of lysosome associated membrane protein-2 (Lamp2) in myocardium. Treatment of I/R mice with BHB reduced mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced adenosine triphosphate production, attenuated mitochondrial swelling, and partly restored mitochondrial membrane potential in myocardium. Furthermore, treatment of I/R mice with BHB abated oxidative stress and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress in myocardium. Our results indicated that treatment with exogenous BHB protected heart from I/R injury in mice.;BACKGROUND: The ketone bodies (KB), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate, have been proposed for the treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders, however, the molecular mechanisms involved in KB protection are not well understood. KB can substitute for glucose and support mitochondrial metabolism increasing cell survival. We have reported that the D-isomer of BHB (D-BHB) stimulates autophagic degradation during glucose deprivation in cultured neurons increasing cell viability. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation process of damaged proteins and organelles activated during nutrient deprivation to obtain building blocks and energy. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can contribute to neuronal death. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to test whether D-BHB can preserve autophagic function in an in vivo model of excitotoxic damage induced by the administration of the glutamate receptor agonist, N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA), in the rat striatum. METHODS: D-BHB was administered through an intravenous injection followed by either an intraperitoneal injection (i.v+i.p) or a continuous epidural infusion (i.v+pump), or through a continuous infusion of D-BHB alone. Changes in the autophagy proteins ATG7, ATG5, BECLIN 1 (BECN1), LC3, Sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/ p62) and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2, were evaluated by immunoblot. The lesion volume was measured in cresyl violet-stained brain sections. RESULTS: Autophagy is activated early after NMDA injection but autophagic degradation is impaired due to the cleavage of LAMP2. Twenty-four h after NMDA intrastriatal injection, the autophagic flux is re-established, but LAMP2 cleavage is still observed. The administration of D-BHB through the i.v+pump protocol reduced the content of autophagic proteins and the cleavage of LAMP2, suggesting decreased autophagosome formation and lysosomal membrane preservation, improving autophagic degradation. D-BHB also reduced brain injury. The i.v+i.p administration protocol and the infusion of D-BHB alone showed no effect on autophagy activation or degradation.;Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. There is no simple treatment to alleviate ischemic brain injury, as thrombolytic therapy is applicable within a narrow time window. During the last years, the ketogenic diet (KD) and the exogenous administration of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have been proposed as therapeutic tools for acute neurological disorders and both can reduce ischemic brain injury. However, the mechanisms involved are not completely clear. We have previously shown that the D enantiomer of BHB stimulates the autophagic flux in cultured neurons exposed to glucose deprivation (GD) and in the brain of hypoglycemic rats. Here, we have investigated the effect of the systemic administration of D-BHB, followed by its continuous infusion after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), on the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Results show for the first time that the protective effect of BHB against MCAO injury is enantiomer selective as only D-BHB, the physiologic enantiomer of BHB, significantly reduced brain injury. D-BHB treatment prevented the cleavage of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2 and stimulated the autophagic flux in the ischemic core and the penumbra. In addition, D-BHB notably reduced the activation of the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway of the UPR and inhibited IRE1alpha phosphorylation. L-BHB showed no significant effect relative to ischemic animals. In cortical cultures under GD, D-BHB prevented LAMP2 cleavage and decreased lysosomal number. It also abated the activation of the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4 pathway, partially sustained protein synthesis, and reduced pIRE1alpha. In contrast, L-BHB showed no significant effects. Results suggest that protection elicited by D-BHB treatment post-ischemia prevents lysosomal rupture allowing functional autophagy, preventing the loss of proteostasis and UPR activation."

Recent clinical trials have shown that a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor improved both cardiac and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on cardiorenal syndrome remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats [OLETF]) and control (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats [LETO]) were treated with canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for 2 weeks. Renal tissues were analyzed at 12 h after MI with or without preoperative fasting. RESULTS: Canagliflozin reduced blood glucose levels in OLETF, and blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by canagliflozin only with fasting. MI increased neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 protein levels in the kidney by 3.2- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in OLETF, but not in LETO. The renal messenger ribonucleic acid level of Toll-like receptor 4 was higher in OLETF than in LETO after MI, whereas messenger ribonucleic acid levels of cytokines/chemokines were not significantly different. Levels of lipid peroxides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4 proteins after MI were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO. Canagliflozin with pre-MI fasting suppressed MI-induced renal expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 in OLETF, together with reductions in lipid peroxides and NOX proteins in the kidney. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels before MI were inversely correlated with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protein levels in OLETF. Pre-incubation with beta-hydroxybutyrate attenuated angiotensin II-induced upregulation of NOX4 in NRK-52E cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment with a fasting period protects kidneys from MI-induced cardiorenal syndrome, possibly by beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated reduction of NOXs and oxidative stress, in type 2 diabetic rats."

We hypothesized that these dynamic health benefits of beta-hydroxybutyrate might stem from its ability to regulate genome architecture through chromatin remodeling via histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, thereby influencing the transcriptome. Focusing on the kidney, which is an end organ protected by beta-hydroxybutyrate, we examined histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation-mediated chromatin remodeling. Notably, regions of the genome associated with lipid catabolism were predominantly in an open chromatin configuration, leading to active transcription and translation. Significant beta-hydroxybutyrylation was observed in the kidneys and the most highly upregulated gene actively transcribed and translated was 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl CoA Synthase 2 ( Hmgcs2 ), a gene responsible for the biosynthesis of beta-hydroxybutyrate in mitochondria. In contrast, regions with more compact chromatin structures were enriched with genes related to immune function such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C ( Ptprc ) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 ( Lcp1 ), which exhibited reduced transcription and translation. These results reveal that renal epigenetic histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, which concurrently modulates both energy metabolism and immune function is a mechanism underlying the dynamic health effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate to protect kidneys and lower hypertension."

Neither betaHB nor AcAc are well utilized for synthesis of sterols or fatty acids in human or rat liver. To study the effects of ketones on cholesterol homeostasis a novel betaHB ester (KE) ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) was synthesized and given orally to rats and humans as a partial dietary carbohydrate replacement. Rats maintained on a diet containing 30-energy % as KE with a concomitant reduction in carbohydrate had lower plasma cholesterol and mevalonate (-40 and -27 %, respectively) and in the liver had lower levels of the mevalonate precursors acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA (-33 and -54 %) compared to controls. Whole liver and membrane LDL-R as well as SREBP-2 protein levels were higher (+24, +67, and +91 %, respectively). When formulated into a beverage for human consumption subjects consuming a KE drink (30-energy %) had elevated plasma betaHB which correlated with decreased mevalonate, a liver cholesterol synthesis biomarker. Partial replacement of dietary carbohydrate with KE induced ketosis and altered cholesterol homeostasis in rats.

We hypothesized that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is involved in the downregulation of LEAP2 during conditions with high circulating levels of BHB. METHODS: Hepatic and intestinal Leap2 expression were determined in 3 groups of mice with increasing circulating levels of BHB: prolonged fasting, prolonged ketogenic diet, and oral BHB treatment. LEAP2 levels were measured in lean and obese individuals, in human individuals following endurance exercise, and in mice after BHB treatment. Lastly, we investigated Leap2 expression in isolated murine hepatocytes challenged with BHB. RESULTS: We confirmed increased circulating LEAP2 levels in individuals with obesity compared to lean individuals. The recovery period after endurance exercise was associated with increased plasma levels of BHB levels and decreased LEAP2 levels in humans. Leap2 expression was selectively decreased in the liver after fasting and after exposure to a ketogenic diet for 3 weeks. Importantly, we found that oral administration of BHB increased circulating levels of BHB in mice and decreased Leap2 expression levels and circulating LEAP2 plasma levels, as did Leap2 expression after direct exposure to BHB in isolated murine hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: From our data, we suggest that LEAP2 is downregulated during different states of energy deprivation in both humans and rodents. Furthermore, we here provide evidence that the ketone body, BHB, which is highly upregulated during fasting metabolism, directly downregulates LEAP2 levels. This may be relevant in ghrelin receptor-induced hunger signaling during energy deprivation.;BACKGROUND: The appetite-suppressing potential of liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2), and its antagonistic effects on the hunger-inducing hormone ghrelin have attracted scientific interest. It is unclear how LEAP2 is influenced by fasting and how it responds to specific nutrients. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether LEAP2 concentration 1) decreases after fasting, 2) increases postprandially, and 3) is regulated by nutrient sensing in the splanchnic bed. METHODS: Plasma LEAP2 concentration was measured in blood samples from 5 clinical cross-over trials, following 1) 36 h of fasting (n = 8), 2) 10 h of fasting (n = 37, baseline data pooled from 4 of the clinical trials), 3) Oral and intravenous glucose administration (n = 11), 4) Oral and intravenous Na-lactate administration (n = 10), and 5) Oral and intravenous Na-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) administration (n = 8). All 5 trials included healthy males. RESULTS: Compared with a 10-h fasting period, the median LEAP2 concentration was 38% lower following 36 h of fasting (P < 0.001). Oral administration of glucose elevated, whereas intravenous glucose administration lowered LEAP2 concentration (intervention x time, P = 0.001), resulting in a mean difference of 9 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1, 17) after 120 min. Oral lactate increased, and intravenous lactate decreased LEAP2 (intervention x time, P = 0.007), with a mean difference between interventions of 10 ng/mL (95% CI: 6, 15) after 120 min. In contrast, oral and intravenous administration of BHB reduced the LEAP2 concentration (main effect of time, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations show that LEAP2 concentration was lower after a 36-h fast than an overnight fast and that oral delivery of glucose and lactate elevated LEAP2 concentration compared with intravenous administration, whereas LEAP2 concentrations decreased with both oral and intravenous BHB. This indicates that the LEAP2 concentration is sensitive to intestinal exposure to specific substrates, highlighting the need for future studies exploring the relationship between nutrients and LEAP2.

Diets contained equal amounts of fat, protein, and micronutrients. The KE group was fed ad libitum, whereas the control (Ctrl) mice were pair-fed to the KE group. Blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in the KE group were 3-5 times those reported with high-fat ketogenic diets. Voluntary food intake was reduced dose dependently with the KE diet. Feeding the KE diet for up to 1 mo increased the number of mitochondria and doubled the electron transport chain proteins, uncoupling protein 1, and mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating proteins in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). [(18)F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in IBAT of the KE group was twice that in IBAT of the Ctrl group. Plasma leptin levels of the KE group were more than 2-fold those of the Ctrl group and were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity to IBAT. The KE group exhibited 14% greater resting energy expenditure, but the total energy expenditure measured over a 24-h period or body weights was not different. The quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index was 73% higher in the KE group. These results identify KE as a potential antiobesity supplement.;Background: D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol - a non-racemic ketone monoester for ingestion - has emerged as an effective way to achieve acute nutritional ketosis. Whether white adipose tissue plays a role in effects of acute nutritional ketosis is largely unknown. Objective: To investigate the effects of acute nutritional ketosis on plasma levels of asprosin and leptin and if they are affected by abdominal fat phenotypes. Methods: The design was a randomised crossover trial. Participants received either the D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (KEbetaHB) drink or placebo drink. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 minutes. 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes (VFV and SFV, respectively), intra-hepatic fat deposition (IHFD), and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD). Results: A total of 18 adults were randomised, with no drop-outs. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of asprosin and leptin (p = 0.808 and p = 0.907, respectively) between the KEbetaHB and placebo drinks. There was no effect of time, treatment, or interaction between time and treatment on asprosin and leptin. After stratification by the VFV/SFV ratio, IHFD, and IPFD, there were no differences in asprosin and leptin between the KEbetaHB and placebo drinks. Conclusion: Plasma levels of asprosin and leptin were not significantly affected by acute nutritional ketosis. Abdominal fat phenotypes did not significantly affect circulating levels of the two hormones. White adipose tissue does not appear to play a role in altering hormone levels during acute nutritional ketosis. The clinical trial registry number is NCT03889210 (https://clinicaltrials.gov)."

Ketones may work through the brain, therefore, we evaluated whether the intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrates would also modulate peripheral energy and glucose homeostasis, and through what mechanisms, in diabetic rats fed a high fat diet in short- and long-term studies. Short-term (3h) central injection of BHB (50 mug/h) improved serum glucose levels and peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) group among 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats, but not in non-diabetic Sham rats. In addition to short-term infusion, long-term (28 days) central infusion of BHB (12 mug/h) elevated serum BHB levels. Long-term infusion of BHB potentiated leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus to slightly decrease body weight in Px rats. Central BHB infusion had a greater effect on peripheral glucose metabolism than overall energy metabolism. Hepatic insulin signaling (tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2-->serine phosphorylation of Akt-->reduced expression of PEPCK) was potentiated and hepatic glucose production in the hyperinsulinemic state was suppressed in the diabetic rats. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved by central BHB infusion through enhanced whole body glucose disposal rates, but insulin secretion was not affected in the diabetic rats. In conclusion, mild ketosis by central infusion of ketones improves energy and glucose metabolism through the potentiation of leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats."

However, whether beta-HB alters the senescence pathway in vascular cells remains unknown. Here we report that beta-HB promotes vascular cell quiescence, which significantly inhibits both stress-induced premature senescence and replicative senescence through p53-independent mechanisms. Further, we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a direct binding target of beta-HB. beta-HB binding to hnRNP A1 markedly enhances hnRNP A1 binding with Octamer-binding transcriptional factor (Oct) 4 mRNA, which stabilizes Oct4 mRNA and Oct4 expression. Oct4 increases Lamin B1, a key factor against DNA damage-induced senescence. Finally, fasting and intraperitoneal injection of beta-HB upregulate Oct4 and Lamin B1 in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in mice in vivo. We conclude that beta-HB exerts anti-aging effects in vascular cells by upregulating an hnRNP A1-induced Oct4-mediated Lamin B1 pathway."

However, in chronic obesity, they can exhibit an activated pro-fibrotic, extracellular matrix (ECM)-depositing phenotype that highly aggravates obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. METHODS: Given that progenitors' fibrotic activation and fat cell browning appear to be antagonistic cell fates, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of pro-browning agents in an obesogenic condition. RESULTS: In obese mice fed a high fat diet, thermoneutral housing, which induces brown fat cell dormancy, increases the expression of ECM gene programs compared to conventionally raised animals, indicating aggravation of obesity-related tissue fibrosis at thermoneutrality. In a model of primary cultured murine adipose progenitors, we found that exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate selectively reduced Tgfbeta-dependent profibrotic responses of ECM genes like Ctgf, Loxl2 and Fn1. This effect is observed in both subcutaneous and visceral-derived adipose progenitors, as well as in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In 30 patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery, those with higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels have lower subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrotic scores. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate limits Tgfbeta-dependent collagen accumulation and reduces Smad2-3 protein expression and phosphorylation in visceral progenitors. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate induces the expression of the ZFP36 gene, encoding a post-transcriptional regulator that promotes the degradation of mRNA by binding to AU-rich sites within 3'UTRs. Importantly, complete ZFP36 deficiency in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line from null mice, or siRNA knock-down in primary progenitors, indicate that ZFP36 is required for beta-hydroxybutyrate anti-fibrotic effects. CONCLUSION: These data unravel the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate to limit adipose tissue matrix deposition, a finding that might exploited in an obesogenic context."

Histone acetylation and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are involved in AD progression. Importantly, LPL has been documented to be regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors (increase histone acetylation level) in adipocyte and mesenchymal stem cells, or by fasting in adipose and muscle tissues. In brain, however, whether histone acetylation or fasting regulates LPL expression is unknown. This study was designed to demonstrate intermittent fasting may protect against AD through increasing beta-hydroxybutyrate, a HDACs inhibitor, to regulate LPL. We also investigated microRNA-29a expression associating with regulation of LPL and histone acetylation. The results showed LPL mRNA expression was increased and microRNA-29a expression was decreased in the cerebral cortex of AD model mice (APP/PS1), which were alleviated by intermittent fasting. No significant differences were found in the total expression of LPL protein (brain-derived and located in capillary endothelial cells from peripheral tissues) in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice. Further study indicated that LPL located in capillary endothelial cells was decreased in the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice, which was alleviated by intermittent fasting. LPL and microRNA-29a expression were separately increased and down-regulated in 2 muM Abeta(25-35)-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, but respectively decreased and up-regulated in 10 muM Abeta(25-35)-exposed cells, which were all reversed by beta-hydroxybutyrate. The increase of HDAC2/3 expression and the decrease of acetylated H3K9 and H4K12 levels were alleviated in APP/PS1 mice by intermittent fasting treatment, as well in 2 or 10 muM Abeta(25-35)-exposed cells by beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment. These findings above suggested the results from APP/PS1 mice were consistent with those from cells treated with 2 muM Abeta(25-35). Interestingly, LPL expression was reduced (0.2-folds) and microRNA-29a expression was up-regulated (1.7-folds) in HDAC2-silenced cells, but respectively increased (1.3-folds) and down-regulated (0.8-folds) in HDAC3-silenced cells. Furthermore, LPL expression was decreased in cells treated with microRNA-29a mimic and increased with inhibitor treatment. In conclusion, intermittent fasting inhibits the increase of brain-derived LPL expression in APP/PS1 mice partly through beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated down-regulation of microRNA-29a expression. HDAC2/3 may be implicated in the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate on microRNA-29a expression."

Therefore, we used a human in vitro BBB model, brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs), to investigate the effect of KBs on the BBB and on Abeta transport. Our results show that KBs do not modify BBB integrity and do not cause toxicity to BLECs. Furthermore, the presence of KBs in the culture media was combined with higher MCT1 and GLUT1 protein levels in BLECs. In addition, KBs significantly enhanced the protein levels of LRP1, P-gp, and PICALM, described to be involved in Abeta clearance. Finally, the combined use of KBs promotes Abeta efflux across the BBB. Inhibition experiments demonstrated the involvement of LRP1 and P-gp in the efflux. This work provides evidence that KBs promote Abeta clearance from the brain to blood in addition to exciting perspectives for studying the use of KBs in therapeutic approaches."

Dietary lipids have been recognized as contributory factors in the development and progression of the disease. Unlike long chain triglycerides, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) increase fat burning in animal and human subjects as well as serum C-peptide in type 2 diabetes patients. We evaluated the beneficial effects of MCT on beta-cells in vivo and in vitro. MCT improved glycemia in aged rats via beta-cell function assessed by measuring insulin secretion and content. In beta-cells, medium chain fatty acid (MCFA)-C10 activated fatty acid receptor 1 FFAR1/GPR40, while MCFA-C8 induced mitochondrial ketogenesis and the C8:C10 mixture improved beta cell function. We showed that GPR40 signaling positively impacts ketone body production in beta-cells, and chronic treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) improves beta-cell function. We also showed that BHB and MCFA help beta-cells recover from lipotoxic stress by improving mitochondrial function and increasing the expression of genes involved in beta-cell function and insulin biogenesis, such as Glut2, MafA, and NeuroD1 in primary human islets. MCFA offers a therapeutic advantage in the preservation of beta-cell function as part of a preventative strategy against diabetes in at risk populations."

Male adult mice were exposed to 30 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously 5 min before reperfusion for continuous delivery of the exogenous BHB (1.6 mmol/kg/24 h). Treatment with BHB reduced infarct size and levels of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum, attenuated apoptosis in myocardium, and preserved cardiac function of I/R mice. Importantly, treatment of I/R mice with BHB promoted autophagic flux, evidenced by reduced the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and protein expression of p62 and enhanced protein expression of lysosome associated membrane protein-2 (Lamp2) in myocardium. Treatment of I/R mice with BHB reduced mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced adenosine triphosphate production, attenuated mitochondrial swelling, and partly restored mitochondrial membrane potential in myocardium. Furthermore, treatment of I/R mice with BHB abated oxidative stress and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress in myocardium. Our results indicated that treatment with exogenous BHB protected heart from I/R injury in mice.;Glucose supply from blood is mandatory for brain functioning and its interruption during acute hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia leads to brain injury. Alternative substrates to glucose such as the ketone bodies (KB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can be used as energy fuels in the brain during hypoglycemia and prevent neuronal death, but the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. During glucose deprivation adaptive cell responses can be activated such as autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent degradation process, to support cell survival. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can lead to cell dysfunction. We have previously shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation in cortical neurons and that D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) reestablishes the autophagic flux increasing viability. Here, we aimed to investigate autophagy dynamics in the brain of rats subjected to severe hypoglycemia (SH) without glucose infusion (GI), severe hypoglycemia followed by GI (SH + GI), and a brief period of hypoglycemic coma followed by GI (Coma). The effect of D-BHB administration after the coma was also tested (Coma + BHB). The transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II and the abundance of autophagy proteins, Beclin 1 (BECN1), ATG7, and ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, were analyzed as an index of autophagosome formation, and the levels of sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) were determined as a hallmark of autophagic degradation. Data suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats after SH, likely due to impaired autophagic degradation. In the cortex, autophagosome accumulation persisted at 6 h after GI in animals exposed to SH but recovered basal levels at 24 h, while in the hippocampus no significant effect was observed. In animals subjected to coma, autophagosome accumulation was observed at 24 h after GI in both regions. D-BHB treatment reduced LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 content and reduced ULK1 phosphorylation by AMPK, suggesting it stimulates the autophagic flux and decreases AMPK activity reducing autophagy initiation. D-BHB also reduced the number of degenerating cells. Together, data suggest different autophagy dynamics after GI in rats subjected to SH or the hypoglycemic coma and support that D-BHB treatment can modulate autophagy dynamics favoring the autophagic flux.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

We have already shown that chronic exposure to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) decreases insulin-mediated activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. To gain further insights into the mechanism underlying ketone body-induced insulin resistance, we examined whether OHB alters activation of the insulin-signaling cascade and whether the insulinomimetic agent vanadate could bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in these cells. Cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5 mM OHB, 50 microM vanadate or both for 16 h before the measurement of glucose uptake or the activation of insulin-signaling molecules. While chronic exposure to OHB did not alter insulin- or vanadate-mediated activation of the insulin receptor, it suppressed insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation in response to both agonists. Furthermore, this treatment decreased by 54 and 36% the phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and PKB in response to insulin, whereas it did not alter vanadate-mediated activation of these enzymes. Although insulin did not significantly stimulate p38MAPK phosphorylation, vanadate increased it by 3.8-fold. Furthermore, chronic exposure to OHB potentiated vanadate's action, resulting in a 250% increase in enzyme activation compared to control cells. Though OHB induced a 2.1-fold increase of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, inhibition of this enzyme with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 demonstrated that ERK1/2 did not participate in OHB-induced insulin resistance. In conclusion, ketone bodies promote insulin resistance probably through decreased activation of the PI3-K/PKB signaling cascade. Furthermore, vanadate can bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in OHB-treated cardiomyocytes.;In aerobic conditions, the heart preferentially oxidizes fatty acids. However, during metabolic stress, glucose becomes the major energy source, and enhanced glucose uptake has a protective effect on heart function and cardiomyocyte survival. Thus abnormal regulation of glucose uptake may contribute to the development of cardiac disease in diabetics. Ketone bodies are often elevated in poorly controlled diabetics and are associated with increased cellular oxidative stress. Thus we sought to determine the effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) on cardiac glucose uptake during metabolic stress. We used 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), an uncoupler of the mitochondrial oxidative chain, to mimic hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. Our data demonstrated that chronic exposure to OHB provoked a concentration-dependent decrease of DNP action, resulting in 56% inhibition of DNP-mediated glucose uptake at 5 mM OHB. This was paralleled by a diminution of DNP-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Chronic exposure to OHB also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by 1.9-fold compared with control cells. To further understand the role of ROS in OHB action, cardiomyocytes were incubated with H(2)O(2). Our results demonstrated that this treatment diminished DNP-induced glucose uptake without altering activation of the AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine partially restored DNP-mediated glucose but not AMPK/p38 MAPK activation. In conclusion, these results suggest that ketone bodies, through inhibition of the AMPK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and ROS overproduction, regulate DNP action and thus cardiac glucose uptake. Altered glucose uptake in hyperketonemic states during metabolic stress may contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy.;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

We have previously reported that mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) is involved in AD by promoting autophagic clearance of amyloid-beta protein precursor via ketone body-associated mechanism, whether HMGCS2 may also regulate Tau metabolism remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: The present study was to investigate the role of HMGCS2 in Tau/p degradation. METHODS: The protein levels of Tau and pTau including pT217 and pT181, as well as autophagic markers LAMP1 and LC3-II were assessed by western blotting. The differentially regulated genes by HMGCS2 were analyzed by RNA sequencing. Autophagosomes were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: HMGCS2 significantly decreased Tau/pTau levels, which was paralleled by enhanced formation of autophagic vacuoles and prevented by autophagic regulators chloroquine, bafilomycin A1, 3-methyladenine, and rapamycin. Moreover, HMGCS2-induced alterations of LAMP1/LC3-II and Tau/pTau levels were mimicked by ketone body acetoacetate or beta-hydroxybutyrate. Further RNA-sequencing identified ankyrin repeat domain 24 (ANKRD24) as a target gene of HMGCS2, and silencing of ANKRD24 reduced LAMP1/LC3-II levels, which was accompanied by the altered formation of autophagic vacuoles, and diminished the effect of HMGCS2 on Tau/pTau. CONCLUSION: HMGCS2 promoted autophagic clearance of Tau/pTau, in which ketone body and ANKRD24 played an important role."
ENSG00000014641,MDH1,,weak,1,21530659,2011,Brain/CNS,Glutamate and glutathione interplay in a motor neuronal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis reveals altered energy metabolism.,"Impairment of mitochondrial function might contribute to oxidative stress associated with neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Glutamate levels in tissues of ALS patients are sometimes altered. In neurons, mitochondrial metabolism of exogenous glutamine is mainly responsible for the net synthesis of glutamate, which is a neurotransmitter, but it is also necessary for the synthesis of glutathione, the main endogenous antioxidant. We investigated glutathione synthesis and glutamine/glutamate metabolism in a motor neuronal model of familial ALS. In standard culture conditions (with glutamine) or restricting glutamine or cystine, the level of glutathione was always lower in the cell line expressing the mutant (G93A) human Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (G93ASOD1) than in the line expressing wild-type SOD1. With glutamine the difference in glutathione was associated with a lower glutamate and impairment of the glutamine/glutamate metabolism as evidenced by lower glutaminase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity. d-beta-hydroxybutyrate, as an alternative to glutamine as energy substrate in addition to glucose, reversed the decreases of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity and glutamate and glutathione. However, in the G93ASOD1 cell line, in all culture conditions the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase l protein, which down-regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, was induced, together with an increase in lactate release in the medium. These findings suggest that the glutathione decrease associated with mutant SOD1 expression is due to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the reduction of the flow of glucose-derived pyruvate through the TCA cycle, it implies altered glutamate metabolism and depends on the different mitochondrial energy substrates."

Under these conditions, it can sustain ATP levels by its oxidation in mitochondria. As mitochondria can modify its shape and function under different nutritional challenges, we study the chronic effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation on mitochondrial morphology and function, and its relation to exercise capacity. Male C57BL/6 mice were supplemented with beta-hydroxybutyrate mineral salt (3.2%) or control (CT, NaCl/KCl) for six weeks and submitted to a weekly exercise performance test. We found an increase in distance, maximal speed, and time to exhaustion at two weeks of supplementation. Fatty acid metabolism and OXPHOS subunit proteins declined at two weeks in soleus but not in tibialis anterior muscles. Oxygen consumption rate on permeabilized fibers indicated a decrease in the presence of pyruvate in the short-term treatment. Both the tibialis anterior and soleus showed decreased levels of Mitofusin 2, while electron microscopy assessment revealed a significant reduction in mitochondrial cristae shape in the tibialis anterior, while a reduction in the mitochondrial number was observed only in soleus. These results suggest that short, but not long-term, beta‑hydroxybutyrate supplementation increases exercise capacity, associated with modifications in mitochondrial morphology and function in mouse skeletal muscle."

The aim of this study was to investigate the antagonizing effects of BHB against diabetic glomerulosclerosis and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes and then treated with different concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate. After 10 weeks, body weight, blood glucose, serum creatinine and 24-h urine protein were examined. Glomerular morphological changes and the contents of collagen type IV (COL IV) were evaluated. Then, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smad3 contents and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) generation were detected. Moreover, the total contents of trans-activating histone H3K9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb) and the contents of H3K9bhb in the Mmp-2 promoter were measured. RESULTS: It was firstly confirmed that BHB treatments reduced renal biochemical indicators and attenuated glomerular morphological changes of the diabetic rats, with COL IV content decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Then, BHB treatments were found to up-regulate renal MMP-2 generation of the diabetic rats significantly, while not affecting the increased TGF-beta/Smad3 contents. Furthermore, the contents of H3K9bhb in the Mmp-2 promoter were elevated significantly for the middle and high concentrations of BHB treatments, up-regulating MMP-2 generation. CONCLUSION: BHB treatments could up-regulate MMP-2 generation via causing elevated H3K9bhb in its promoter to antagonize glomerulosclerosis in the diabetic rats."

This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC."

However, how an LC diet impacts on cardiac pathology during haemodynamic stress remains elusive. This study evaluated the effects of an LC diet high in either fat (Fat-LC) or protein (Pro-LC) in a mouse model of chronic hypertensive cardiac remodelling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction, followed by feeding with the Fat-LC, the Pro-LC, or a high-carbohydrate control diet. After 4 weeks, echocardiographic, haemodynamic, histological, and biochemical analyses were performed. LC diet consumption after pressure overload inhibited the development of pathological hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction compared to the control diet. An anti-hypertrophic serine/threonine kinase, GSK-3beta, was re-activated by both LC diets, however, the Fat-LC, but not the Pro-LC, diet exerted cardioprotection in GSK-3beta cardiac-specific knockout mice. beta-hydroxybutyrate, a major ketone body in mammals, was increased in the hearts of mice fed the Fat-LC, but not the Pro-LC, diet. In cardiomyocytes, ketone body supplementation inhibited phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy, in part by suppressing mTOR signalling. CONCLUSION: Strict carbohydrate restriction suppresses pathological cardiac growth and heart failure after pressure overload through distinct anti-hypertrophic mechanisms elicited by supplemented macronutrients.;BACKGROUND: Ketogenic diet (KD) has been proposed to be an effective lifestyle intervention in metabolic syndrome. However, the effects of KD on cardiac remodeling have not been investigated. Our aim was to investigate the effects and the underling mechanisms of KD on cardiac remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). METHODS: 10-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to normal diet or ketogenic diet for 4 weeks. Then, their blood pressure and cardiac remodeling were assessed. Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old neonatal pups. The cells were then cultured with ketone body with or without TGF-beta to investigate the mechanism in vitro. RESULTS: 4 weeks of KD feeding aggravated interstitial fibrosis and cardiac remodeling in SHRs. More interestingly, ketogenic diet feeding increased the activity of mammalian target of rapamyoin (mTOR) complex 2 pathway in the heart of SHRs. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate strengthened the progression of TGF-beta-induced fibrosis in isolated cardiac fibroblasts. mTOR inhibition reversed this effect, indicating that ketone body contributes to cardiac fibroblasts via mTOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ketogenic diet may lead to adverse effects on the remodeling in the hypertensive heart, and they underscore the necessity to fully evaluate its reliability before clinical use.;Mild endurance exercise has been shown to compensate for declined muscle quality and may positively affect the brain under conditions of energy restriction. Whether this involves brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in relation to central and peripheral tissue levels of associated factors such as beta hydroxy butyrate (BHB), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and thyroid hormone (T3) has not been studied. Thus, a subset of male Wistar rats housed at thermoneutrality that were fed or fasted was submitted to 30-min-mild treadmill exercise bouts (five in total, twice daily, 15 m/min, 0 degrees  inclination) over a period of 66 h. Prefrontal cortex and gastrocnemius muscle BHB, BCAA, and thyroid hormone were measured by LC-MS/MS analysis and were related to BDNF and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In gastrocnemius muscle, mild endurance exercise during fasting maintained the fasting-induced elevated BHB levels and BDNF-CREB activity and unlocked the downstream Akt-mTORC1 pathway associated with increased tissue BCAA. Consequently, deiodinase 3 mRNA levels decreased whereas increased phosphorylation of the mTORC2 target FOXO1 was associated with increased deiodinase 2 mRNA levels, accounting for the increased T3 tissue levels. These events were related to increased expression of CREB and T3 target genes beneficial for muscle quality previously observed in this condition. In rat L6 myoblasts, BHB directly induced BDNF transcription and maturation. Mild endurance exercise during fasting did not increase prefrontal cortex BHB levels nor was BDNF activated, whereas increased leucine levels were associated with Akt-independent increased phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target P70S6K. The associated increased T3 levels modulated the expression of known T3-target genes involved in brain tissue maintenance. Our observation that mild endurance exercise modulates BDNF, mTOR and T3 during fasting provides molecular clues to explain the observed beneficial effects of mild endurance exercise in settings of energy restriction.;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).;Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury after revascularization contributes  approximately 50% of infarct size and causes heart failure, for which no established clinical treatment exists. beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), which serves as both an energy source and a signaling molecule, has recently been reported to be cardioprotective when administered immediately before I/R and continuously after reperfusion. This study aims to determine whether administering beta-OHB at the time of reperfusion with a single dose can alleviate I/R injury and, if so, to define the mechanisms involved. We found plasma beta-OHB levels were elevated during ischemia in STEMI patients, albeit not to myocardial protection level, and decreased after revascularization. In mice, compared with normal saline, beta-OHB administrated at reperfusion reduced infarct size (by 50%) and preserved cardiac function, as well as activated autophagy and preserved mtDNA levels in the border zone. Our treatment with one dose beta-OHB reached a level achievable with fasting and strenuous physical activity. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) subjected to I/R, beta-OHB at physiologic level reduced cell death, increased autophagy, preserved mitochondrial mass, function, and membrane potential, in addition to attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. ATG7 knockdown/knockout abolished the protective effects of beta-OHB observed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, beta-OHB's cardioprotective effects were associated with inhibition of mTOR signaling. In conclusion, beta-OHB, when administered at reperfusion, reduces infarct size and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by increasing autophagic flux (potentially through mTOR inhibition). Since beta-OHB has been safely tested in heart failure patients, it may be a viable therapeutic to reduce infarct size in STEMI patients."

The aim was to test the effects of sodium-ss-hydroxybutyrate (SBHB) infusion on brain injury in a clinically relevant swine model of CA. RESULTS: CA was electrically induced in 20 adult swine. After 10 min, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 5 min. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the animals were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of balanced crystalloid (controls, n = 11) or SBHB (theoretical osmolarity 1189 mOsm/l, n = 8) for 12 h. Multimodal neurological and cardiovascular monitoring were implemented in all animals. Nineteen of the 20 animals achieved ROSC. Blood sodium concentrations, osmolarity and circulating KBs were higher in the treated animals than in the controls. SBHB infusion was associated with significantly lower plasma biomarkers of brain injury at 6 (glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP and neuron specific enolase, NSE) and 12 h (neurofilament light chain, NFL, GFAP and NSE) compared to controls. The amplitude of the stereoelectroencephalograph (sEEG) increased in treated animals after ROSC compared to controls. Cerebral glucose uptake was lower in treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental model, SBHB infusion after resuscitated CA was associated with reduced circulating markers of cerebral injury and increased sEEG amplitude."
ENSG00000162992,NEUROD1,0.59149873,weak,1,29649104,2018,Pancreas,Coordination of GPR40 and Ketogenesis Signaling by Medium Chain Fatty Acids Regulates Beta Cell Function.,"Diabetes prevalence increases with age, and beta-cell dysfunction contributes to the incidence of the disease. Dietary lipids have been recognized as contributory factors in the development and progression of the disease. Unlike long chain triglycerides, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) increase fat burning in animal and human subjects as well as serum C-peptide in type 2 diabetes patients. We evaluated the beneficial effects of MCT on beta-cells in vivo and in vitro. MCT improved glycemia in aged rats via beta-cell function assessed by measuring insulin secretion and content. In beta-cells, medium chain fatty acid (MCFA)-C10 activated fatty acid receptor 1 FFAR1/GPR40, while MCFA-C8 induced mitochondrial ketogenesis and the C8:C10 mixture improved beta cell function. We showed that GPR40 signaling positively impacts ketone body production in beta-cells, and chronic treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) improves beta-cell function. We also showed that BHB and MCFA help beta-cells recover from lipotoxic stress by improving mitochondrial function and increasing the expression of genes involved in beta-cell function and insulin biogenesis, such as Glut2, MafA, and NeuroD1 in primary human islets. MCFA offers a therapeutic advantage in the preservation of beta-cell function as part of a preventative strategy against diabetes in at risk populations."

Burgeoning evidence suggests that ketosis, in particular beta-hydroxybutyrate, exerts a beneficial effect on aging and on myriad metabolic or chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. Its effect on DKD is largely unknown. In vitro in podocytes exposed to a diabetic milieu, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment substantially mitigated cellular senescence and injury, as evidenced by reduced formation of gammaH2AX foci, reduced staining for senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity, diminished expression of key mediators of senescence signaling like p16(INK4A) and p21, and preserved expression of synaptopodin. This beneficial action of beta-hydroxybutyrate coincided with a reinforced transcription factor Nrf2 antioxidant response. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a convergent point for myriad signaling pathways regulating Nrf2 activity, seems to contribute. Indeed, trigonelline, a selective inhibitor of Nrf2, or ectopic expression of constitutively active mutant GSK3beta abolished, whereas selective activation of Nrf2 was sufficient for the anti-senescent and podocyte protective effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Moreover, molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate is able to directly target the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3beta and thereby block its kinase activity. In murine models of streptozotocin-elicited DKD, beta-hydroxybutyrate therapy inhibited GSK3beta and reinforced Nrf2 activation in glomerular podocytes, resulting in lessened podocyte senescence and injury and improved diabetic glomerulopathy and albuminuria. Thus, our findings may pave the way for developing a beta-hydroxybutyrate-based novel approach of therapeutic ketosis for treating DKD.;Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) have been proposed to mediate systemic metabolic response to fasting. However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart.;Progressive cognitive decline and increased brain iron deposition with age are important features of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have found that the short-term ketogenic diet has neuroprotective effects in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, but the effects of an early and long-term ketogenic diet on brain iron content and cognition of Alzheimer's disease have not been reported. In our study, 8-week-old APP/PS1 mice were given a 12-month ketogenic or standard diet, while C57BL/6 mice matched with the age and genetic background of APP/PS1 mice were used as normal controls to be given a standard diet for the same length of time. We found that 12 months of an early ketogenic diet improved the impaired learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. The improvement of cognitive function may be related to the reduction of amyloid-beta deposition and neuronal ferroptosis. The mechanism was achieved by the regulation of ferroptosis-related pathways after activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 by ketogenic diet-induced elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate. In addition, blood biochemical results showed that compared with the standard diet group of the disease, although the early and long-term ketogenic diet increased blood lipids to some extent, it seemed to reduce liver, renal, and myocardial damage caused by genetic differences. This will provide a piece of positive evidence for the early and long-term use of ketogenic diets in people at risk of Alzheimer's disease.;Ketone bodies (KBs) are an alternative energy source under starvation and play multiple roles as signaling molecules regulating energy and metabolic homeostasis. The mechanism by which KBs influence visceral white adipose tissue physiology is only partially known, and our study aimed to shed light on the effects they exert on such tissue. To this aim, we administered 1,3-butanediol (BD) to rats since it rapidly enhances beta-hydroxybutyrate serum levels, and we evaluated the effect it induces within 3 h or after 14 days of treatment. After 14 days of treatment, rats showed a decrease in body weight gain, energy intake, gonadal-WAT (gWAT) weight, and adipocyte size compared to the control. BD exerted a pronounced antioxidant effect and directed redox homeostasis toward reductive stress, already evident within 3 h after its administration. BD lowered tissue ROS levels and oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and enhanced tissue soluble and enzymatic antioxidant capacity as well as nuclear erythroid factor-2 protein levels. BD also reduced specific mitochondrial maximal oxidative capacity and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as interrelated processes, leading to changes in the level of adipokines/cytokines involved in inflammation, macrophage infiltration into gWAT, adipocyte differentiation, and lipolysis.;A ketogenic diet (KD) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) have been widely reported as effective therapies for metabolic diseases. beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in ketone metabolism. In this study, we examined the BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We found that BDH1 is downregulated in the kidneys in DKD mouse models, patients with diabetes, and high glucose- or palmitic acid-induced human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells. BDH1 overexpression or betaOHB treatment protects HK-2 cells from glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by inhibiting reactive oxygen species overproduction. Mechanistically, BDH1-mediated betaOHB metabolism activates NRF2 by enhancing the metabolic flux of betaOHB-acetoacetate-succinate-fumarate. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that adeno-associated virus 9-mediated BDH1 renal expression successfully reverses fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in the kidneys of C57 BKS db/db mice. Either betaOHB supplementation or KD feeding could elevate the renal expression of BDH1 and reverse the progression of DKD. Our results revealed a BDH1-mediated molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of DKD and identified BDH1 as a potential therapeutic target for DKD.;One of the therapeutic approaches to age-related diseases is modulation of body cell metabolism through certain diets or their pharmacological mimetics. The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in signal transduction in inflammatory conditions. However, alterations in TLR expression following hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation have not been well documented. This study was conducted to measure the impact of different resuscitation strategies on TLR expression and downstream signaling in key organs. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats (n=38) were subjected to a severe volume-controlled hemorrhage protocol. After 75 min of shock, they were resuscitated over 45 min as follows: (1) lactated Ringer's (LR, 81 ml/kg), (2) ketone Ringer's (KR, 81 ml/kg), (3) 7.5% hypertonic saline (HTS, 9.7 ml/kg), (4) 6% hetastarch (HEX, 27 ml/kg), (5) pyruvate Ringer's (PR, 81 ml/kg). Sham hemorrhage (NH) and no resuscitation (NR) groups served as controls. The KR and PR solutions were identical to LR except for equimolar substitution of racemic lactate with beta hydroxybutyrate and sodium pyruvate, respectively. At the end of resuscitation, the expression of TLRs (types 1-10), and cytokines (IL-10, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) were measured in the lung and spleen using RT-PCR. Levels of phosphorylated and total IkB-alpha and NF-kappaB were detected by Western blotting. The systemic and lung protein levels of TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Expression of TLRs in the lung was affected more than in the spleen by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. In the lung, hemorrhage increased TLR-2, -3 and -6 (but not TLR-4) mRNA expression, with an up-regulation of the ratio of phosphor-NF-kappaBp65 and total NF-kappaBp65, NF-kappaBp65 activation, and enhanced systemic and tissue TNF-alpha protein levels. Post-resuscitation, TLR mRNA profile and subsequent downstream proteins in the lung and spleen were affected by the choice of resuscitation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic shock activates TLR signaling in lung, but not the spleen, probably through an up-regulation of TLR gene expression, and activation of NF-kappaB pathway. Resuscitation modulates this response in a fluid- and tissue-specific fashion.;This study investigates the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity during traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Evans blue (EB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as determinants of BBB permeability. Glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated in the right (injury side) cerebral cortex of animals. The gene expression levels for occludin, glucose transporter (Glut)-1, aquaporin4 (AQP4) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were performed, and Glut-1 and NF-kappaB activities were analyzed. BHB treatment decreased GSH and MDA levels in intact animals and in those exposed to TBI (P<0.05). Glut-1 protein levels decreased in sham, BHB and TBI plus BHB groups (P<0.05). NF-kappaB protein levels increased in animals treated with BHB and/or exposed to TBI (P<0.05). The expression levels of occludin and AQP4 did not significantly change among experimental groups. Glut-1 expression levels increased in BHB treated and untreated animals exposed to TBI (P<0.05). While NF-kappaB expression levels increased in animals in TBI (P<0.01), a decrease was noticed in these animals upon BHB treatment (P<0.01). In animals exposed to TBI, EB extravasation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex regardless of BHB treatment. Ultrastructurally, BHB attenuated but did not prevent the presence of HRP in brain capillary endothelial cells of animals with TBI, moreover, the drug also led to the observation of the tracer when used in intact rats (P<0.01). Altogether, these results showed that BHB not only failed to provide overall protective effects on BBB in TBI but also led to BBB disruption in healthy animals.;Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major challenge in liver surgery. Diet restriction reduces liver damage by increasing stress resistance, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the preventive effect of 12-h fasting on mouse liver IRI. Partial warm hepatic IRI model in wild-type male C57BL/6 mice was used. The control ischemia and reperfusion (IR) group of mice was given food and water ad libitum, while the fasting IR group was given water but not food for 12 h before ischemic insult. In 12-h fasting mice, serum liver-derived enzyme level and tissue damages due to IR were strongly suppressed. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was significantly raised before ischemia and during reperfusion. Up-regulated BHB induced an increment in the expression of FOXO1 transcription factor by raising the level of acetylated histone. Antioxidative enzyme heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a target gene of FOXO1, then increased. Autophagy activity was also enhanced. Serum high-mobility group box 1 was remarkably lowered by the 12-h fasting, and activation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production and liver injury were reduced. Exogenous BHB administration or histone deacetylase inhibitor administration into the control fed mice ameliorated liver IRI, while FOXO1 inhibitor administration to the 12-h fasting group exacerbated liver IRI. The 12-h fasting exerted beneficial effects on the prevention of liver IRI by increasing BHB, thus up-regulating FOXO1 and HO-1, and by reducing the inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death via the down-regulation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."

Whether induction of hyperglycemia or ketonemia achieves better neuroprotection is unknown. Hyperglycemia is neuroprotective in other brain injuries during development, however, it worsens hypoglycemia-induced injury in the adult brain via poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) overactivation. METHODS: Three-week-old rats were subjected to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and treated with 10% dextrose or 50% dextrose. Neuronal injury, PARP-1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) III/TrkB/p75(NTR) expressions were determined. In the second experiment, ketonemia was induced by administering beta-hydroxybutyrate during hypoglycemia and its effect on neuronal injury was compared with those conventionally treated using 10% dextrose. RESULTS: Both 10 and 50% dextrose administration led to hyperglycemia (50% dextrose > 10% dextrose). Compared with the 10% dextrose group, neuronal injury was greater in the 50% dextrose group and was accompanied by PARP-1 overactivation. BDNF III and p75(NTR), but not TrkBFL, mRNA expressions were upregulated. Neuronal injury was less severe in the rats subjected to ketonemia, compared with those conventionally treated using 10% dextrose. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia accentuated hypoglycemia-induced neuronal injury, likely via PARP-1 overactivation. Although BDNF was upregulated, it was not neuroprotective and potentially exaggerated injury by binding to p75(NTR) receptor. Conversely, ketonemia during hypoglycemia attenuated neuronal injury."

Two recent studies identified the sulfonylurea MCC950 and the ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate as specific inhibitors of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, with promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of auto-inflammatory diseases.;beta-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body that is used as an energy source in organs such as the brain, muscle, and heart when blood glucose is low, is produced by fatty acid oxidation in the liver under the fasting state. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;Aging and lipotoxicity are two major risk factors for gout that are linked by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Neutrophil-mediated production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) drives gouty flares that cause joint destruction, intense pain, and fever. However, metabolites that impact neutrophil inflammasome remain unknown. Here, we identified that ketogenic diet (KD) increases beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and alleviates urate crystal-induced gout without impairing immune defense against bacterial infection. BHB inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome in S100A9 fibril-primed and urate crystal-activated macrophages, which serve to recruit inflammatory neutrophils in joints. Consistent with reduced gouty flares in rats fed a ketogenic diet, BHB blocked IL-1beta in neutrophils in a NLRP3-dependent manner in mice and humans irrespective of age. Mechanistically, BHB inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils by reducing priming and assembly steps. Collectively, our studies show that BHB, a known alternate metabolic fuel, is also an anti-inflammatory molecule that may serve as a treatment for gout.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe motor and sensory dysfunction and significantly reduces the quality of life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of administration of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in spinal cord-injured mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given a moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury at the T(9-10) level and treated with exogenous DBHB. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of SCI mice with DBHB markedly improved locomotor function and relieved SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation. DBHB treatment partly prevented the SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and suppressed microglial and glial activation. DBHB treatment enhanced histone acetylation and up-regulated expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, catalase and SOD2 in injured region of SCI mice. DBHB treatment suppressed SCI-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced protein expression of IL-1beta and IL-18. In addition, DBHB treatment improved mitochondrial function and abated oxidative stress following SCI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DBHB promoted functional recovery and relieved pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through inhibition of histone deacetylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preservation of mitochondrial function. DBHB could thus be envisaged as a potential use of interventions for SCI but remains to be tested in humans.;Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and results in debilitating motor deficits. The accumulation and spread of neurotoxic synuclein aggregates in the form of Lewy bodies is a key pathological feature of PD. Chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by protein aggregates is emerging as a major pathogenic mechanism in progressive neurodegenerative disorders and is considered an important therapeutic target. Recently the ketone body, beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), was shown to efficiently inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, and in vivo models of inflammatory disease. Furthermore, BHB can readily cross the blood brain barrier suggesting that it could have therapeutic benefits for the management of PD. In this study, we evaluated if BHB could inhibit chronic microglial inflammasome activation induced by pathological fibrillar synuclein aggregates. Interestingly, we found that BHB treatment almost completely blocked all aspects of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis induced by ATP and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, consistent with previously published reports in macrophages. Surprisingly however, BHB did not inhibit inflammasome activation and release of IL-1beta or caspase-1 induced by synuclein fibrils. Our results demonstrate that BHB does not block the upstream pathways regulating inflammasome activation by synuclein fibrils and suggest that synuclein mediated inflammasome activation proceeds via distinct mechanisms compared to traditional NLRP3 activators such as ATP and MSU.;Background: Neuroprotective effects of ketogenic diets (KD) have been reported in stroke models, and nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke. This study aimed to investigate the effects of KD on NLRP3 inflammasome and explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Methods: In in vivo study, mice were fed with KD for 3 weeks and then subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injury. In in vitro study, SH-SY-5Y cells were treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) followed by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). NLRP3 inflammasome activation and related regulatory mechanisms were evaluated. Results: Mice fed with KD had increased tolerance to MCAO/R. KD inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and suppressed TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the brain. The in vitro study showed BHB (10 mM) prevented the mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to inhibit mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, BHB decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inhibited ROS-NLRP3 pathway in OGD/R-treated cells, and suppressed ER stress-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Conclusions: KD may suppress ER stress and protect mitochondrial integrity by suppressing the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus exerting neuroprotective effects. Our findings provide evidence for the potential application of KD in the prevention of ischemic stroke.;Dietary salt reduction and exercise are lifestyle modifications for salt-sensitive hypertensives. While exercise has prominent metabolic effects, salt has an adverse effect on metabolic syndrome, of which hypertension is a hallmark. We hypothesized that dietary salt impacts metabolism in a salt-sensitive model of hypertension. An untargeted metabolomic approach demonstrates lower circulating levels of the ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), in high salt-fed hypertensive rats. Despite the high salt intake, specific rescue of betaOHB levels by nutritional supplementation of its precursor, 1,3-butanediol, attenuates hypertension and protects kidney function. This beneficial effect of betaOHB was likely independent of gut-microbiotal and Th17-mediated effects of salt and instead facilitated by betaOHB inhibiting the renal Nlrp3 inflammasome. The juxtaposed effects of dietary salt and exercise on salt-sensitive hypertension, which decrease and increase betaOHB respectively, indicate that nutritional supplementation of a precursor of betaOHB provides a similar benefit to salt-sensitive hypertension as exercise.;SCOPE: Cell culture studies indicate that the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) directly inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key regulator of inflammation. However, direct evidence demonstrating this effect in humans is lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the effects of acutely raising blood beta-OHB in healthy humans, two separate randomized double-blind placebo-controlled experiments are conducted using similar methods but each employed different exogenous ketone supplements. Participants' blood beta-OHB is directly elevated by ketone salts (0.3 g beta-OHB per kg, Study 1, N = 10 males) or ketone monoester (0.482 g beta-OHB per kg, Study 2, N = 18, equal males/females). Markers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation include caspase-1, IL-1beta secretion, and IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA in LPS-stimulated whole blood collected at the baseline and 30 minutes following supplementation. Caspase-1 activation increases after ketone salt (Study 1: condition x time interaction, p = 0.012) and monoester supplementation (Study 2: condition x time interaction, p = 0.016) compared to placebo. IL-1beta secretion increases (main effect of condition, p = 0.024, Study 2) while IL1B and NLRP3 mRNA remain unchanged. CONCLUSION: Measures of NLRP3 activation increases when blood beta-OHB is elevated using ketone supplements, suggesting that increasing beta-OHB exogenously may have unintended effects that augment inflammatory activation.;Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major challenge in liver surgery. Diet restriction reduces liver damage by increasing stress resistance, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the preventive effect of 12-h fasting on mouse liver IRI. Partial warm hepatic IRI model in wild-type male C57BL/6 mice was used. The control ischemia and reperfusion (IR) group of mice was given food and water ad libitum, while the fasting IR group was given water but not food for 12 h before ischemic insult. In 12-h fasting mice, serum liver-derived enzyme level and tissue damages due to IR were strongly suppressed. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was significantly raised before ischemia and during reperfusion. Up-regulated BHB induced an increment in the expression of FOXO1 transcription factor by raising the level of acetylated histone. Antioxidative enzyme heme oxigenase 1 (HO-1), a target gene of FOXO1, then increased. Autophagy activity was also enhanced. Serum high-mobility group box 1 was remarkably lowered by the 12-h fasting, and activation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome was suppressed. Consequently, inflammatory cytokine production and liver injury were reduced. Exogenous BHB administration or histone deacetylase inhibitor administration into the control fed mice ameliorated liver IRI, while FOXO1 inhibitor administration to the 12-h fasting group exacerbated liver IRI. The 12-h fasting exerted beneficial effects on the prevention of liver IRI by increasing BHB, thus up-regulating FOXO1 and HO-1, and by reducing the inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death via the down-regulation of NF-kappaB and NLRP3 inflammasome.;Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in humans with type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Activation of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and subsequent interleukin (IL)-1beta release induces atherosclerosis and heart failure. Here we show the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk receive SGLT2 inhibitor or sulfonylurea for 30 days, with NLRP3 inflammasome activation analyzed in macrophages. While the SGLT2 inhibitor's glucose-lowering capacity is similar to sulfonylurea, it shows a greater reduction in IL-1beta secretion compared to sulfonylurea accompanied by increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and decreased serum insulin. Ex vivo experiments with macrophages verify the inhibitory effects of high BHB and low insulin levels on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitor attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which might help to explain its cardioprotective effects.;BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of acute infusion of the primary ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate, in heart failure (HF). However, whether chronic elevations in circulating ketones are beneficial remains unknown. METHODS: To chronically elevate circulating ketones in mice, we deleted the expression of the ketolytic, rate-limiting-enzyme, SCOT (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase 1, encoded by Oxct1), in skeletal muscle. Tamoxifen-inducible skeletal muscle-specific Oxct1(Muscle-)(/)(-) knockout (n=32) mice and littermate controls (wild type, WT, n=35) were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce HF. RESULTS: Deletion of SCOT in skeletal, but not cardiac muscle resulted in elevated concentrations of fasted circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate in knockout mice compared with WT mice (P=0.030). Five weeks following TAC, WT mice progressed to HF, whereas knockout mice with elevated fasting circulating ketones were largely protected from the TAC-induced effects observed in WT mice (ejection fraction, P=0.011, mitral E/A, P=0.012). Furthermore, knockout mice with TAC had attenuated expression of markers of sterile inflammation and macrophage infiltration, which were otherwise elevated in WT mice subjected to TAC. Lastly, addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate to isolated hearts was associated with reduced NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3)-inflammasome activation, which has been previously shown to play a role in contributing to HF-induced cardiac inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that chronic elevation of circulating ketones protects against the development of HF that is associated with the ability of beta-hydroxybutyrate to directly reduce inflammation. These beneficial effects of ketones were associated with reduced cardiac NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that ketones may modulate cardiac inflammation via this mechanism.;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, late-onset dementia with no effective treatment available. Recent studies suggest that AD pathology is driven by age-related changes in metabolism. Alterations in metabolism, such as placing patients on a ketogenic diet, can alter cognition by an unknown mechanism. One of the ketone bodies produced as a result of ketogenesis, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), is known to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, we tested if BHB inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome reduces overall AD pathology in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Here, we find BHB levels are lower in red blood cells and brain parenchyma of AD patients when compared with non-AD controls. Furthermore, exogenous BHB administration reduced plaque formation, microgliosis, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (Asc) speck formation, and caspase-1 activation in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BHB reduces AD pathology by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Additionally, our data suggest dietary or pharmacological approaches to increase BHB levels as promising therapeutic strategies for AD.;Ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to be beneficial in a range of neurological disorders, with ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) reported to block the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in bone marrow-derived macrophages. In this study, we show that pretreatment with KD or in situ betaOHB suppressed macrophages/microglia activation and the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, while KD downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, KD promoted macrophages/microglia transformation from the M1 phenotype to the M2a phenotype following spinal cord injury (SCI) in the in vivo study. Rats in the KD group demonstrated improved behavioral and electrophysiological recovery after SCI when compared to those rats in the standard diet group. The in vitro study performed on BV2 cells indicated that betaOHB inhibited an LPS+ATP-induced inflammatory response and decreased NLRP3 protein levels. Our data demonstrated that pretreatment with KD attenuated neuroinflammation following SCI, probably by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and shifting the activation state of macrophages/microglia from the M1 to the M2a phenotype. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB might provide a potential future therapeutic strategy for SCI.;RATIONALE: Over 50% of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction. Complexity of its pathophysiology and the lack of animal models hamper the development of effective therapy for HFpEF. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the metabolic mechanisms of HFpEF and test therapeutic interventions using a novel animal model. METHODS AND RESULTS: By combining the age, long-term high-fat diet, and desoxycorticosterone pivalate challenge in a mouse model, we were able to recapture the myriad features of HFpEF. In these mice, mitochondrial hyperacetylation exacerbated while increasing ketone body availability rescued the phenotypes. The HFpEF mice exhibited overproduction of IL (interleukin)-1beta/IL-18 and tissue fibrosis due to increased assembly of NLPR3 inflammasome on hyperacetylated mitochondria. Increasing beta-hydroxybutyrate level attenuated NLPR3 inflammasome formation and antagonized proinflammatory cytokine-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction and fibrosis. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate downregulated the acetyl-CoA pool and mitochondrial acetylation, partially via activation of CS (citrate synthase) and inhibition of fatty acid uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we identify the interplay of mitochondrial hyperacetylation and inflammation as a key driver in HFpEF pathogenesis, which can be ameliorated by promoting beta-hydroxybutyrate abundance.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.;BACKGROUND: Aseptic Loosening (AL) following periprosthetic osteolysis is the main long-term complication after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However, there is rare effective treatment except for revision surgery, which is costly and painful to the patients. In recent years, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has attracted much attention and has been proved to be beneficial in many chronic diseases. With respect to the studies on the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), its anti-inflammatory ability has been widely investigated. Although the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate has been applied in many inflammatory diseases and has achieved considerable therapeutic efficacy, its effect on wear particles induced osteolysis is still unknown. RESULTS: In this work, we confirmed that the anti-inflammatory action of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) could be reappeared in CoCrMo alloy particles induced osteolysis. Mechanistically, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) deactivated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by CoCrMo alloy particles. Of note, this inhibitory action was independent of Gpr109a receptor as well as histone deacetylase (HDAC) suppression. Furthermore, given that butyrate, one kind of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) structurally related to beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), has been reported to be an inhibitor of osteoclast, thus we also investigate the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on osteoclast, which was contributed to bone resorption. It was found that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) did not only affect osteoclast differentiation, but also inhibit its function. Unlike the inflammasome, the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on osteoclast may mainly rely on histone deacetylase (HDAC) suppression. CONCLUSIONS: In general, our study showed that the alleviation of osteolysis may owe to the effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on inflammasome deactivation and osteoclast.;Cisplatin, as a commonly used anticancer drug, can easily lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), and has received more and more attention in clinical practice. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) is a metabolite in the body and acts as an inhibitor of oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing inflammatory responses and apoptosis. However, the role of BHB in cisplatin-induced AKI is currently not fully elucidated. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into normal control group, cisplatin-induced AKI group and AKI with BHB treatment group. Compared to the control, cisplatin-treated mice exhibited high level of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and severe tubular injury, which accompanied with significantly increased expression level of NLRP3, IL-1beta, IL-18, BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, as well as aggravated oxidative stress and renal tubular cell apoptosis. However, these changes were significantly improved in that of BHB treatment. In vitro, our study showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase3, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) treated with cisplatin compared with the control group, while decreased in cells treated with BHB. Furthermore, a significantly increased expression of cGAS and STING in HK-2 cells treated with cisplatin were found, whereas notably decreased in cells treated with BHB. This data indicates that BHB protects against cisplatin-induced AKI and renal tubular damage mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING pathway.;BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms, and affects millions of people worldwide. Growing evidence implies beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the ketone bodies generated by ketogenesis, plays a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to verify the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB on PD and further explore potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We performed the experiments on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice model in vivo and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-simulated BV2 cell model in vitro, with or without BHB pretreatment. Motor function was assessed by pole test, forced swimming test, traction test and open field test. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in MPTP-induced PD model mice. The expression of the STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway was measured by western blots. Proinflammatory cytokines was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: BHB treatment reversed motor deficits, loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in PD mice induced by MPTP. Moreover, BHB inhibited microglia pyroptosis by negatively regulating STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway, resulting in downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18) in vivo and vitro. CONCLUSION: These data suggested BHB supplement inhibited pyroptosis by down-regulating STAT3-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation for PD models in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provided novel insights and available interventions for the prevention and treatment of PD, and highlighted pyroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for PD.;Aging is accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, but the mechanisms that allow this to persist are not well understood. Ketone bodies are alternative fuels produced when glucose is limited and improve indicators of healthspan in aging mouse models. Moreover, the most abundant ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate, inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome in myeloid cells, a key potentiator of age-related inflammation. Given that myeloid cells express ketogenic machinery, we hypothesized this pathway may serve as a metabolic checkpoint of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we conditionally ablated ketogenesis by disrupting expression of the terminal enzyme required for ketogenesis, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase (HMGCL). By deleting HMGCL in the liver, we validated the functional targeting and establish that the liver is the only organ that can produce the life-sustaining quantities of ketone bodies required for survival during fasting or ketogenic diet feeding. Conditional ablation of HMGCL in neutrophils and macrophages had modest effects on body weight and glucose tolerance in aging but worsened glucose homeostasis in myeloid cell-specific Hmgcl-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that during aging, liver-derived circulating ketone bodies might be more important for deactivating the NLRP3 inflammasome and controlling organismal metabolism.;The current report describes a stepwise mechanistic pathway of NLRP3/caspase1/IL-18-regulated immune responses operational in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We show that esophageal epithelial cells and macrophage-derived NLRP3 regulated IL-18 initiate the disease and induced IL-5 facilitates eosinophil growth and survival. We also found that A. fumigatus-exposed IL-18(-/-) mice or IL-18-neutralized mice are protected from EoE induction. Most importantly, we present that intravascular rIL-18 delivery to DeltadblGATA mice and CD2-IL-5 mice show the development of EoE characteristics feature like degranulated and intraepithelial eosinophils, basal cell hyperplasia, remodeling and fibrosis. Similarly, we show an induced NLRP3-caspase1-regulated IL-18 pathway is also operational in human EoE. Lastly, we present the evidence that inhibitors of NLRP3 and caspase-1 (MCC950, BHB, and VX-765) protect A. fumigatus- and corn-extract-induced EoE pathogenesis. In conclusion, the current study provides a new understanding by implicating NLRP3/caspase1-regulated IL-18 pathway in EoE pathogenesis. The study has the clinical significance and novel therapeutic strategy, which depletes only IL-18-responsive pathogenic eosinophils, not naive IL-5-generated eosinophils critical for maintaining innate immunity.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;BACKGROUND: Ketone bodies are pleotropic metabolites that play important roles in multiple biological processes ranging from bioenergetics to inflammation regulation via suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and epigenetic modifications. Ketone bodies are elevated in left ventricular failure (LVF) and multiple approaches that increase ketone concentrations exert advantageous cardiac effects in rodents and humans. However, the relationships between ketone bodies and right ventricular failure (RVF) are relatively unexplored. METHODS: 51 PAH patients were dichotomized into preserved or impaired RV function based on a cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m(2). Impaired RV function patients were further segmented into intermediate or severe RV dysfunction based on a right atrial pressure of 8 mm Hg. Serum ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) were quantified using ultra performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. In rodent studies, male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to three groups: control (saline injection), monocrotaline (MCT) standard chow diet (MCT-Standard), and MCT ketogenic diet (MCT-Keto). Immunoblots and confocal microscopy probed macrophage NLRP3 activation in RV extracts and sections. RV fibrosis was determined by Picrosirus Red. Echocardiography evaluated RV function. Pulmonary arteriole remodeling was assessed from histological specimens. RESULTS: Human RVF patients lacked a compensatory ketosis as serum AcAc and betaOHB levels were not associated with hemodynamic, echocardiographic, or biochemical measures of RV dysfunction. In rodent studies, AcAc and betaOHB levels were also not elevated in MCT-mediated RVF, but the ketogenic diet significantly increased AcAc and betaOHB levels. MCT-Keto exhibited suppressed NLRP3 activation with a reduction in NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein), pro-caspase-1, and interleukin-1 beta on immunoblots. Moreover, the number of ASC-positive macrophage in RV sections was reduced, RV fibrosis was blunted, and RV function was augmented in MCT-Keto rats. CONCLUSION: The ketogenic response is blunted in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients with RVF. In the MCT rat model of PAH-mediated RVF, a dietary-induced ketosis improves RV function, suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and combats RV fibrosis. The summation of these data suggest ketogenic therapies may be particularly efficacious in RVF, and therefore future studies evaluating ketogenic interventions in human RVF are warranted.;Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a ketone body synthesized during fasting or strenuous exercise. Our previous study demonstrated that a cyclic ketogenic diet (KD), which induces BHB levels similar to fasting every other week, reduces midlife mortality and improves memory in aging mice. BHB actively regulates gene expression and inflammatory activation through non-energetic signaling pathways. Neither of these activities has been well-characterized in the brain and they may represent mechanisms by which BHB affects brain function during aging. First, we analyzed hepatic gene expression in an aging KD-treated mouse cohort using bulk RNA-seq. In addition to the downregulation of TOR pathway activity, cyclic KD reduces inflammatory gene expression in the liver. We observed via flow cytometry that KD also modulates age-related systemic T cell functions. Next, we investigated whether BHB affects brain cells transcriptionally in vitro. Gene expression analysis in primary human brain cells (microglia, astrocytes, neurons) using RNA-seq shows that BHB causes a mild level of inflammation in all three cell types. However, BHB inhibits the more pronounced LPS-induced inflammatory gene activation in microglia. Furthermore, we confirmed that BHB similarly reduces LPS-induced inflammation in primary mouse microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). BHB is recognized as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome, and an agonist of the GPCR Hcar2. Nevertheless, in microglia, BHB's anti-inflammatory effects are independent of these known mechanisms. Finally, we examined the brain gene expression of 12-month-old male mice fed with one-week and one-year cyclic KD. While a one-week KD increases inflammatory signaling, a one-year cyclic KD reduces neuroinflammation induced by aging. In summary, our findings demonstrate that BHB mitigates the microglial response to inflammatory stimuli, like LPS, possibly leading to decreased chronic inflammation in the brain after long-term KD treatment in aging mice.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.;Hyperglycemia and bacterial colonization in diabetic wounds aberrantly activate Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in macrophages, resulting in extensive inflammatory infiltration and impaired wound healing. Targeted suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome shows promise in reducing macrophage inflammatory disruptions. However, challenges such as drug off-target effects and degradation via lysosomal capture remain during treatment. In this study, engineered apoptotic bodies (BHB-dABs) derived from adipose stem cells loaded with beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) were synthesized via biosynthesis. These vesicles target M1-type macrophages, which highly express the folic acid receptor in the inflammatory microenvironment, and facilitate lysosomal escape through 1,2-distearoyl-sn-propyltriyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol functionalization, which may enhance the efficacy of NLRP3 inhibition for managing diabetic wounds. In vitro studies demonstrated the biocompatibility of BHB-dABs, their selective targeting of M1-type macrophages, and their ability to release BHB within the inflammatory microenvironment via folic acid and folic acid receptor signaling. These nanovesicles exhibited lysosomal escape, anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial protection, and endothelial cell vascularization properties. In vivo experiments demonstrated that BHB-dABs enhance the recovery of diabetic wound inflammation and angiogenesis, accelerating wound healing. These functionalized apoptotic bodies efficiently deliver NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors using a dual strategy of targeting macrophages and promoting lysosomal escape. This approach represents a novel therapeutic strategy for effectively treating chronic diabetic wounds.;Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which accounts for the majority of cases, is sturdily influenced by lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, obesity, and diabetes, leading to its classification as Type 3 diabetes. To model this pathological link, our AD-like model was developed by feeding Wistar male rats a high-fat diet with fructose in drinking water (HFFD) for 8 weeks, followed by a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This group was compared with a normal control group fed a standard diet and a beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)-treated group (125 mg/kg, p.o.), administered starting 3 h after LPS and continuing for 1 week. The results demonstrate that BHB treatment illuminated cognitive gains, as indicated by the Y-maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests. In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1beta/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function."

While our knowledge in this area has rapidly expanded in leukocytes, much less is known about the metabolic regulation of brain-resident microglia. In particular, the role of alternative nutrients to glucose remains poorly understood. Here, we use stable-isotope ((13)C) tracing strategies and metabolomics to characterize the oxidative metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in human (HMC3) and murine (BV2) microglia cells and the interplay with glucose in resting and LPS-activated BV2 cells. We found that BHB is imported and oxidised in the TCA cycle in both cell lines with a subsequent increase in the cytosolic NADH:NAD(+) ratio. In BV2 cells, stimulation with LPS upregulated the glycolytic flux, increased the cytosolic NADH:NAD(+) ratio and promoted the accumulation of the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The addition of BHB enhanced LPS-induced accumulation of DHAP and promoted glucose-derived lactate export. BHB also synergistically increased LPS-induced accumulation of succinate and other key immunometabolites, such as alpha-ketoglutarate and fumarate generated by the TCA cycle. Finally, BHB upregulated the expression of a key pro-inflammatory (M1 polarisation) marker gene, NOS2, in BV2 cells activated with LPS. In conclusion, we identify BHB as a potentially immunomodulatory metabolic substrate for microglia that promotes metabolic reprogramming during pro-inflammatory response.;Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by disrupted immune function. Indeed, gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolomic profile alterations, are hallmarks of IBD. In this scenario, metabolite-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), involved in several biological processes, have emerged as pivotal players in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of this study was to characterize the axis microbiota-metabolite-GPCR in intestinal surgical resections from IBD patients. Results showed that UC patients had a lower microbiota richness and bacterial load, with a higher proportion of the genus Cellulosimicrobium and a reduced proportion of Escherichia, whereas CD patients showed a decreased abundance of Enterococcus. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in carboxylic acids, fatty acids, and amino acids in UC and CD samples. These patients also exhibited upregulated expression of most metabolite-sensing GPCRs analysed, which positively correlated with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers. The role of GPR109A was studied in depth and increased expression of this receptor was detected in epithelial cells and cells from lamina propria, including CD68+ macrophages, in IBD patients. The treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate increased gene expression of GPR109A, CD86, IL1B and NOS2 in U937-derived macrophages. Besides, when GPR109A was transiently silenced, the mRNA expression and secretion of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were impaired in M1 macrophages. Finally, the secretome from siGPR109A M1 macrophages reduced the gene and protein expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1 in intestinal fibroblasts. A better understanding of metabolite-sensing GPCRs, such as GPR109A, could establish their potential as therapeutic targets for managing IBD."
ENSG00000164867,NOS3,0.36385667,weak,1,15345971,2004,Brain/CNS; Liver; Lung,D-lactate increases pulmonary apoptosis by restricting phosphorylation of bad and eNOS in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock.,"Resuscitation with racemic lactated Ringer's solution (containing equal amounts of D and L isomers of lactate) has been shown to induce pulmonary apoptosis. Substitution of DL-isomer lactate with ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BHB), sodium pyruvate, or L-isomer of lactate decrease this injury without changing the energy status of the tissues or the expression of apoptotic genes. These modified solutions however alter the function of apoptotic proteins through an unknown mechanism. We postulated that DL-LR induces apoptosis by restricting the phosphorylation of key apoptotic proteins. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 30, 5/group) were subjected to a three stage, volume-controlled hemorrhage and randomized to the following groups. 1) No hemorrhage (Sham), 2) Hemorrhage and no resuscitation (NR), 3) Resuscitation with 3x shed blood volume of racemic LR (DL-LR), 4) Resuscitation with 3x shed blood volume of LR containing only the L-isomer of lactate (L-LR), 5) Resuscitation with 3s shed blood volume of pyruvate Ringer's (PR), 6) Resuscitation with 3s shed blood volume of ketone Ringer's (KR). The modified Ringer's solutions were identical to racemic LR except for equimolar substitution of DL-lactate for L-lactate, pyruvate and BHB respectively. Lung tissue was obtained 2 hours later and subjected to Western Blotting. The levels of Akt, Bad, and eNOS (total and phosphorylated) proteins were measured. Finally, the expression of gene coding for protein 14-3-3 was measured using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Resuscitation with DL-LR caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the total Bad and a decrease in phosphorylated Bad protein expression in the lung. It also caused an increase in the phosphorylated Akt levels and a decrease in gene coding for protein 14-3-3. These changes were consistent with signaling imbalances that favor apoptosis. Modified LR solutions, on the other hand, did not cause these alterations. Phosphorylation pattern of eNOS supported the involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway in this process. CONCLUSION: Racemic lactate plays a role in the induction of pulmonary apoptosis by restricting phosphorylation of Bad and eNOS proteins."

Hyperketonemia (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate) is frequently found along with hyperglycemia in T1D. Whether hyperketonemia per se contributes to the excess oxidative stress and cellular injury observed in T1D is not known. METHODS: HUVEC were treated with ketones in the presence or absence of high glucose for 24 h. NOX4 siRNA was used to specifically knockdown NOX4 expression in HUVEC. RESULTS: Ketones alone or in combination with high glucose treatment cause a significant increase in oxidative stress, ICAM-1, and monocyte adhesivity to HUVEC. Using an antisense approach, we show that ketone induced increases in ROS, ICAM-1 expression, and monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells were prevented in NOX4 knockdown cells. CONCLUSION: This study reports that elevated levels of ketones upregulate NOX, contributing to increased oxidative stress, ICAM-1 levels, and cellular dysfunction. This provides a novel biochemical mechanism that elucidates the role of hyperketonemia in the excess cellular injury in T1D. New drugs targeting inhibition of NOX seems promising in preventing higher risk of complications associated with T1D.;The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), is reported to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate effects of betaOHB on suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in in vivo and in vitro models. Rats were fed with ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) for 3 weeks. A C5 hemi-contusion injury was applied to these animals on the 14th day of experiment, and spinal cord samples were harvested on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after SCI, respectively. The blood ketone levels were significantly higher in the KD groups. KD reduced oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products, downregulated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and upregulated the expression of forkhead box group O (FOXO)3a, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and catalase after SCI. The in vitro study, performed on PC12 cells, indicated that betaOHB inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production, decreased NOX2 and NOX4 protein levels, and upregulated FOXO3a, MnSOD, and catalase levels in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the in vivo results. The ketone metabolite betaOHB inhibited HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 activity, but not HDAC8 in SCI rats and PC12 cells. Depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production and protein carbonylation and elevated FOXO3a protein levels, meanwhile reducing NOX2 and NOX4 protein expression in PC12 cells. Our results indicate that the ketone metabolite betaOHB attenuates oxidative stress in SCI by inhibition of class I HDACs, and selected suppression of HDAC1 or HDAC2 regulates FOXO3a, NOX2, and NOX4 expression. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.;AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor of acute kidney injury after myocardial infarction (MI), a form of cardiorenal syndrome. Recent clinical trials have shown that a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor improved both cardiac and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on cardiorenal syndrome remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats [OLETF]) and control (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats [LETO]) were treated with canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for 2 weeks. Renal tissues were analyzed at 12 h after MI with or without preoperative fasting. RESULTS: Canagliflozin reduced blood glucose levels in OLETF, and blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were increased by canagliflozin only with fasting. MI increased neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 protein levels in the kidney by 3.2- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in OLETF, but not in LETO. The renal messenger ribonucleic acid level of Toll-like receptor 4 was higher in OLETF than in LETO after MI, whereas messenger ribonucleic acid levels of cytokines/chemokines were not significantly different. Levels of lipid peroxides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4 proteins after MI were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO. Canagliflozin with pre-MI fasting suppressed MI-induced renal expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1 in OLETF, together with reductions in lipid peroxides and NOX proteins in the kidney. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels before MI were inversely correlated with neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin protein levels in OLETF. Pre-incubation with beta-hydroxybutyrate attenuated angiotensin II-induced upregulation of NOX4 in NRK-52E cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment with a fasting period protects kidneys from MI-induced cardiorenal syndrome, possibly by beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated reduction of NOXs and oxidative stress, in type 2 diabetic rats."

As an initial step toward development of ketone therapies, we investigated the effect of chronic oral ketone ester (KE) supplementation as a prevention or treatment strategy in rodent heart failure models. METHODS: Two independent rodent heart failure models were used for the studies: transverse aortic constriction/myocardial infarction (MI) in mice and post-MI remodeling in rats. Seventy-five mice underwent a prevention treatment strategy with a KE comprised of hexanoyl-hexyl-3-hydroxybutyrate KE (KE-1) diet, and 77 rats were treated in either a prevention or treatment regimen using a commercially available beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol monoester (DeltaG, KE-2) diet. RESULTS: The KE-1 diet in mice elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels during nocturnal feeding, whereas the KE-2 diet in rats induced ketonemia throughout a 24-hour period. The KE-1 diet preventive strategy attenuated development of left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-transverse aortic constriction/MI (left ventricular ejection fraction+/-SD, 36+/-8 in vehicle versus 45+/-11 in KE-1, P=0.016). The KE-2 diet therapeutic approach also attenuated left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-MI (left ventricular ejection fraction, 41+/-11 in MI-vehicle versus 61+/-7 in MI-KE-2, P<0.001). In addition, ventricular weight, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, and the expression of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) were significantly attenuated in the KE-2-treated MI group. However, treatment with KE-2 did not influence cardiac fibrosis post-MI. The myocardial expression of the ketone transporter and 2 ketolytic enzymes was significantly increased in rats fed KE-2 diet along with normalization of myocardial ATP levels to sham values. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic oral supplementation with KE was effective in both prevention and treatment of heart failure in 2 preclinical animal models. In addition, our results indicate that treatment with KE reprogrammed the expression of genes involved in ketone body utilization and normalized myocardial ATP production following MI, consistent with provision of an auxiliary fuel. These findings provide rationale for the assessment of KEs as a treatment for patients with heart failure.;We have previously demonstrated that exogenous ketosis reduces urine production during exercise. However, the underlying physiological mechanism of this antidiuretic effect remained unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether acute exogenous ketosis by oral ingestion of ketone ester (KE) during a simulated cycling race (RACE) affects the hormonal pathways implicated in fluid balance regulation during exercise. In a double-blind crossover design, 11 well-trained male cyclists participated in RACE consisting of a 3-h submaximal intermittent cycling (IMT(180')) bout followed by a 15-min time trial (TT(15')) in an environmental chamber set at 28 degrees C and 60% relative humidity. Fluid intake was adjusted to maintain euhydration. Before and during RACE, the subjects received either a control drink (CON) or the ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (KE), which elevated blood beta-hydroxybutyrate to  approximately 2-4 mM. Urine output during IMT(180') was  approximately 20% lower in KE (1,172 +/- 557 mL) than in CON (1,431 +/- 548 mL, P < 0.05). Compared with CON, N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-pro ANP) concentration during RACE was  approximately 20% lower in KE (P < 0.05). KE also raised plasma noradrenaline concentrations during RACE. Performance in TT(15') was similar between CON and KE. In conclusion, exogenous ketosis suppresses diuresis and downregulates NT-pro ANP secretion during exercise.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We previously demonstrated that exogenous ketosis reduces urine production during exercise, however, the underlying physiological mechanism remained unclear. Here, we, for the first time demonstrate that exogenous ketosis suppresses the exercise-induced release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). However, given the limited effects of ANP on renal haemodynamics during exercise, the underlying physiological mechanism remains unknown. But downregulation of ANP might explain a new physiological mechanism by which exogenous ketosis lowers blood-free fatty acid levels."

In particular, psychological trait-like construct related to eating has been shown to be an important target for intervention. Methods and measures: This study aimed to investigate the biochemical variables associated with a decrease in emotional and external eating behaviors due to 12-week ketogenic diet (12KD) in 35 adult participants (12 males) with obesity. Results: Absolute changes in emotional and external eating were independent of changes in body mass, nutritional intake, and Delta cortisol, but were predicted with increases in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and decreases in serum peripheral neuropeptide Y (pNPY) (all p's < 0.050). Decrease in pNPY was also associated with an increase in BHB but was independent of anthropometrical changes, Delta fasting glucose, and Delta insulin. Conclusion: The reductions in emotional and external eating behaviors in participants with obesity were uniquely predicted by an increase in BHB and a decrease in pNPY after 12KD. In ketosis, emotional and external eating dropped independently of body mass change. Change in pNPY predicted changes in emotional and external eating. The role of BHB in modulating eating behavior should be further explored."

The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

This study was designed to investigate whether beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), an endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, upregulates the expression of TrkA by affecting histone acetylation in SH-SY5Y cells treated with amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). The results showed that BHB ameliorated the reduction of cell vitality and downregulation of TrkA expression induced by Abeta. Furthermore, BHB inhibited the upregulation of HDAC1/2/3 expression and downregulation of histone acetylation (Ace-H3K9 and Ace-H4K12) levels in Abeta-treated cells. The expression of TrkA was upregulated in HDAC1- or 3-silenced SH-SY5Y cells. However, there was no significant difference in TrkA expression between the HDAC2 knockdown and control cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BHB protects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The underlying mechanism of the effect may be associated with the upregulation of TrkA expression by inhibiting HDAC1/3."

However, the exact mechanisms whereby physical exercise produces an induction in brain Bdnf gene expression are not well understood. While pharmacological doses of HDAC inhibitors exert positive effects on Bdnf gene transcription, the inhibitors represent small molecules that do not occur in vivo. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule released after exercise is capable of inducing key promoters of the Mus musculus Bdnf gene. The metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate, which increases after prolonged exercise, induces the activities of Bdnf promoters, particularly promoter I, which is activity-dependent. We have discovered that the action of beta-hydroxybutyrate is specifically upon HDAC2 and HDAC3, which act upon selective Bdnf promoters. Moreover, the effects upon hippocampal Bdnf expression were observed after direct ventricular application of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that beta-hydroxybutyrate causes an increase in neurotransmitter release, which is dependent upon the TrkB receptor. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF.;Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), an endogenous NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, has been shown to be associated with the pathophysiology of depression in rodents. However its active mechanism has not been revealed. Herein, we probed both the pathways and brain regions involved in BHB's antidepressant-like effects in a learned helplessness (LH) rat model of depression. A single bilateral infusion of BHB into the cerebral ventricles induced the antidepressant-like effects on the LH rats. The antidepressant-like effects of BHB were blocked by the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12 and the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX, indicating that the antidepressant-like effects of BHB involve BDNF-TrkB signaling and AMPA receptor activation. Further, infusions of BHB into the prelimbic and infralimbic portions of medial prefrontal cortex, the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, and the basolateral region of amygdala produced the antidepressant-like effects on LH rats. However, infusions of BHB into the central region of amygdala, the CA3 region of hippocampus, and the shell and core regions of nucleus accumbens had no effect. Finally, a single bilateral infusion of BHB into the cerebral ventricles of naive rats strengthened learning ability on repeated active avoidance test where saline-infused animals failed to increase avoidance responses."

The gene expression levels for occludin, glucose transporter (Glut)-1, aquaporin4 (AQP4) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were performed, and Glut-1 and NF-kappaB activities were analyzed. BHB treatment decreased GSH and MDA levels in intact animals and in those exposed to TBI (P<0.05). Glut-1 protein levels decreased in sham, BHB and TBI plus BHB groups (P<0.05). NF-kappaB protein levels increased in animals treated with BHB and/or exposed to TBI (P<0.05). The expression levels of occludin and AQP4 did not significantly change among experimental groups. Glut-1 expression levels increased in BHB treated and untreated animals exposed to TBI (P<0.05). While NF-kappaB expression levels increased in animals in TBI (P<0.01), a decrease was noticed in these animals upon BHB treatment (P<0.01). In animals exposed to TBI, EB extravasation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex regardless of BHB treatment. Ultrastructurally, BHB attenuated but did not prevent the presence of HRP in brain capillary endothelial cells of animals with TBI, moreover, the drug also led to the observation of the tracer when used in intact rats (P<0.01). Altogether, these results showed that BHB not only failed to provide overall protective effects on BBB in TBI but also led to BBB disruption in healthy animals.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC."

They are utilized by the body with the help of succinyl CoA transferase (SCOT), which is ubiquitously expressed in various organs. Previously, we identified a novel SCOT-t specifically expressed in testicular germ cells and sperm, substituting somatic cell-type SCOT, however the physiological role of SCOT-t had not then been clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ketone bodies, the substrate of SCOT-t, on the motility and acrosome reaction of mouse sperm. D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate both stimulated the motility of sperm as glucose or pyruvate. The glycolysis inhibitor stopped the motility of sperm mediated by glucose but not by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate. In contrast, ketone bodies did not stimulate the activation of the acrosome reaction of sperm, different from the effect of glucose. These results indicate that ketone bodies could be involved in sperm movement but not the acrosome reaction and the SCOT-t enzyme we have identified in sperm mitochondria may have important roles in the activity of sperm, resulting in male infertility when its function is disabled.;Background Heart failure is responsible for approximately 65% of deaths in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, existing therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus have limited success on the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate elevation in D-beta-hydroxybutyrate improves cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Type 2 diabetic (db/db) and their corresponding wild-type mice were fed a control diet or a diet where carbohydrates were equicalorically replaced by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (ketone ester [KE]). After 4 weeks, echocardiography demonstrated that a KE diet improved systolic and diastolic function in db/db mice. A KE diet increased expression of mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase and restored decreased expression of mitochondrial beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, key enzymes in cardiac ketone metabolism. A KE diet significantly enhanced both basal and ADP-mediated oxygen consumption in cardiac mitochondria from both wild-type and db/db animals, however, it did not result in the increased mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Additionally, db/db mice on a KE diet had increased resistance to oxidative and redox stress, with evidence of restoration of decreased expression of thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidase 4 and less permeability transition pore activity in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy were significantly increased in cardiomyocytes from db/db mice on a KE diet. The increase in mitophagy was correlated with restoration of mitofusin 2 expression, which contributed to improved coupling between cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase translocation into mitochondria and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-mediated autophagosome formation. Conclusions Moderate elevation in circulating D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels via KE supplementation enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and oxygen consumption and increases resistance to oxidative/redox stress and mPTP opening, thus resulting in improvement of cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.;beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB, 3-hydroxybutyric acid) may serve as a signaling metabolite in many physiological processes beyond a fuel source for tissues. However, whether and how it is involved in ketone body metabolism is still unknown. The present study aims to investigate the role of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) modification mediated by beta-HB in regulating ketone body metabolic homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. The starvation ketosis and type 1 diabetes mouse models were introduced to evaluate the influence of beta-HB on Kbhb modification in mice. The Kbhb modifications of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1) and HMG-CoA synthase 2, two rate-limiting enzymes involved in ketogenesis and utilization, showed a positive correlation with the level of beta-HB both in vitro and in vivo. The modification levels of the enzymes increased during fasting but decreased after refeeding. However, the Kbhb modification level in all detected tissues showed minor change since the blood ketone body increased nonsignificantly in the type 1 diabetes mouse model. The in vitro experiments further indicated that mutation at the Kbhb modification site significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity of OXCT1 but not HMG-CoA synthase 2. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) were identified both in vitro and in vivo as potential Kbhb dehydrogenase and transferase for OXCT1, respectively. Kbhb modification at lysine 421 of OXCT1 increases its enzyme activity during beta-HB accumulation, accelerating the utilization of the ketone body and finally maintaining metabolism homeostasis. Our present study proposes a new ketone body metabolic regulatory mode primarily mediated by Kbhb modifications of OXCT1 during beta-HB accumulation."

However, the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior in healthy individuals and the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these effects, including neuroinflammation, are unelucidated. This study investigated the sex-specific effects of KD on anxiety-like behavior and the neuroimmune response in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of healthy C57BL/6J male and female mice. Animals were fed either a control diet (CD- 17% fat, 65% carb, 18% protein) or a KD (80% fat, 5% carb, 15% protein) for 4 weeks. KD increased the levels of circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) both in males and females. However, PFC BHB levels were found to be elevated only in KD males. Moreover, KD did not affect the behavior of females but improved motor abilities and reduced anxiety levels in males. KD suppressed the mRNA expression of the pan microglial markers (Cd68, P2ry12) and induced morphological changes in the male PFC microglia. A sex-specific decrease in IL1beta and an increase in IL-10 levels was found in the PFC of KD males. A similar trend was observed in the hippocampus of males where KD reduced the mRNA expression of P2ry12, Il1beta, and cFos. Additionally, BHB increased the production of IL-10 whereas it decreased the production of IL1beta from human microglia in in-vitro conditions. In summary, these results demonstrate that the anxiolytic and motor function enhancement abilities of KD are male-specific. Reduced pro-inflammatory and improved anti-inflammatory factors in the male PFC and hippocampus may underlie these effects."

We hypothesized that the use of energy substrates, such as ketone bodies, in the resuscitation fluids would protect against this injury. As markers of cellular injury we measured the induction of apoptotic cell death and the expression of Intracellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1). STUDY DESIGN: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 35) under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia had placement of femoral arterial and venous catheters. A three-stage hemorrhage model was used for this experiment. There was an initial hemorrhage of 27 mL/kg for 10 minutes. During the next 75 minutes another 8 mL/kg of blood was withdrawn at a steady rate. The resuscitation fluids were then infused for 45 minutes during which the third continuous hemorrhage of 8 mL/kg was performed. The animals were randomized to five groups: 1) sham hemorrhage (n = 6), 2) sham resuscitation (n = 7), 3) Lactated Ringer's resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 8), 4) Ketone Ringer's (containing 28 mEq/L of beta-hydroxybutyrate) resuscitation, three times the volume of shed blood (n = 7), and 5) plasma resuscitation, volume equal to shed blood (n = 7). The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after resuscitation and lungs were harvested. Western blot technique was used for the determination of proapoptotic protein (bax), antiapoptotic protein (bcl-2), apoptotic fragments of poly ADP-ribose polymerase, and ICAM-1. Sections of lung were also subjected to immunostaining using antibodies to bax and ICAM-1 proteins (reported as number of positive cells/mm2). RESULTS: Lactated Ringer's resuscitation caused a significant increase in pulmonary apoptosis and ICAM-1 expression compared with the sham hemorrhage group. Animals resuscitated with Ketone Ringer's solution and plasma did not show this injury pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of lactate with ketone bodies in the resuscitation fluid attenuates the expression of cellular injury markers in the lung.;Hypoxia decreased survival of cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons in a time dependent manner. Addition of 4 mM Na D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (bHB), a ketone body, protected the cells for 2 hr and maintained the increase in survival compared to that of controls for up to 6 hr. Trypan blue exclusion indicated that acute cell death was reduced markedly after 2-hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group. The presence of bHB also decreased the number of neurons exhibiting condensed nuclei visualized by propidium iodide, indicative of apoptosis. The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Em/c) was maintained for up to 2 hr exposure to hypoxia in the bHB-treated group, whereas the potential in the control group was decreased. Furthermore, cytochrome C release, caspase-3 activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage were decreased in the bHB-treated group for the first 2 hr of exposure. These findings indicate that ketone bodies may be a candidate for widening the therapeutic window before thrombolytic therapy and at the same time decreasing apoptotic damage in the ischemic penumbra.;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of central nervous system (CNS). Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

Adenosine was almost totally metabolized by the liver cells during the first 4 h of the induction period. The inhibitory action of adenosine was also observed using dibutyryl-cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP as inducer, it could not be prevented by the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine nor could it be mimicked by the selective adenosine receptor agonist N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine. 2) Acetoacetate suppressed the induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in a concentration-dependent manner between 5 and 20mM during the first 4 h after glucagon addition. beta-Hydroxybutyrate showed no effect. Neither starting with acetoacetate nor with beta-hydroxybutyrate did the cell cultures establish the thermodynamic equilibrium between the two compounds. 3) Ammonia did not affect induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase at concentrations up to 2mM. Ammonia was converted to urea within the first 4 h, yet it remained at clearly hyperphysiological concentrations in the medium during that period. It is concluded that the glucagon-dependent induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was modulated by the local hormone adenosine via a mechanism not involving adenylate cyclase and by acetoacetate via an unknown mechanism. The inhibitory action of adenosine may, that of acetoacetate can hardly be physiologically relevant.;Ketogenic diets (KTD) are reported to have beneficial effects on the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis, but remain controversial. We investigated the effects of KTD and ketones on insulin resistance and secretion in non-obese type 2 diabetic rats and their mechanism. KTD (82% energy as fat), intraperitoneal injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (IHB, 150 mg/kg bw/12 h) with a control diet (COD, 20% energy as fat) or saline injection with COD was given to 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats for five weeks. KTD increased epididymal fat pads and serum leptin levels without increasing energy intake, but IHB decreased them. KTD, but not IHB, attenuated hypothalamic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in KTD. Serum glucagon levels were markedly higher in the KTD group than in other groups. During an oral glucose tolerance test, serum glucose levels slowly increased until 80 min in the KTD group and then decreased very slowly. Insulin secretion capacity during a hyperglycemic clamp was significantly lower in the IHB group than in other groups. However, a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp revealed that KTD decreased glucose infusion rates and increased hepatic glucose output in hyperinsulinemic states while IHB had opposite effects to KTD. The increased hepatic glucose output in KTD was associated with increased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression through attenuated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 and phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473). Hepatic AMPK(Thr172) phosphorylation was reduced in KTD. In conclusion, KTD impairs energy and glucose homeostasis by exacerbating insulin resistance and attenuating hypothalamic leptin signaling in non-obese type 2 diabetic rats. These changes are not associated with increased serum ketone levels.;Although the effects of ketogenic diets on energy and glucose homeostasis have been controversial, elevation of serum ketone levels by subcutaneous injection of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can improve glucose homeostasis. Ketones may work through the brain, therefore, we evaluated whether the intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrates would also modulate peripheral energy and glucose homeostasis, and through what mechanisms, in diabetic rats fed a high fat diet in short- and long-term studies. Short-term (3h) central injection of BHB (50 mug/h) improved serum glucose levels and peripheral insulin sensitivity compared to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) group among 90% pancreatectomized (Px) diabetic rats, but not in non-diabetic Sham rats. In addition to short-term infusion, long-term (28 days) central infusion of BHB (12 mug/h) elevated serum BHB levels. Long-term infusion of BHB potentiated leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus to slightly decrease body weight in Px rats. Central BHB infusion had a greater effect on peripheral glucose metabolism than overall energy metabolism. Hepatic insulin signaling (tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2-->serine phosphorylation of Akt-->reduced expression of PEPCK) was potentiated and hepatic glucose production in the hyperinsulinemic state was suppressed in the diabetic rats. In addition, glucose tolerance was improved by central BHB infusion through enhanced whole body glucose disposal rates, but insulin secretion was not affected in the diabetic rats. In conclusion, mild ketosis by central infusion of ketones improves energy and glucose metabolism through the potentiation of leptin and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats.;Glycogen has long been considered to have a function in energy metabolism. However, our recent study indicated that glycogen metabolism, directed by cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Pck1, controls the formation and maintenance of CD8(+) memory T (T(mem)) cells by regulating redox homeostasis(1). This unusual metabolic program raises the question of how Pck1 is upregulated in CD8(+) T(mem) cells. Here, we show that mitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A is diverted to the ketogenesis pathway, which indirectly regulates Pck1 expression. Mechanistically, ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate is present in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, beta-hydroxybutyrate epigenetically modifies Lys 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) of Foxo1 and Ppargc1a (which encodes PGC-1alpha) with beta-hydroxybutyrylation, upregulating the expression of these genes. As a result, FoxO1 and PGC-1alpha cooperatively upregulate Pck1 expression, therefore directing the carbon flow along the gluconeogenic pathway to glycogen and the pentose phosphate pathway. These results reveal that ketogenesis acts as an unusual metabolic pathway in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, linking epigenetic modification required for memory development.;OBJECTIVES: During fasting, liver pivotally regulates blood glucose levels through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Kidney also produces glucose through gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenic genes are transactivated by fasting, but their expression patterns are chronologically different between the two organs. We find that renal gluconeogenic gene expressions are positively correlated with the blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Thus, we herein aim to investigate the regulatory mechanism and its physiological implications. METHODS: Gluconeogenic gene expressions in liver and kidney were examined in hyperketogenic mice such as high-fat diet (HFD)-fed and ketogenic diet-fed mice, and in hypoketogenic PPARalpha knockout (PPARalpha(-/-)) mice. Renal gluconeogenesis was evaluated by rise in glycemia after glutamine loading in vivo. Functional roles of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the regulation of renal gluconeogenesis were investigated by metabolome analysis and RNA-seq analysis of proximal tubule cells. RESULTS: Renal gluconeogenic genes were transactivated concurrently with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate uprise under ketogenic states, but the increase was blunted in hypoketogenic PPARalpha(-/-) mice. Administration of 1,3-butandiol, a ketone diester, transactivated renal gluconeogenic gene expression in fasted PPARalpha(-/-) mice. In addition, HFD-fed mice showed fasting hyperglycemia along with upregulated renal gluconeogenic gene expression, which was blunted in HFD-fed PPARalpha(-/-) mice. In vitro experiments and metabolome analysis in renal tubular cells showed that beta-hydroxybutyrate directly promotes glucose and NH(3) production through transactivating gluconeogenic genes. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate-induced transactivation of Pck1 was mediated by C/EBPbeta. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that beta-hydroxybutyrate mediates hepato-renal interaction to maintain homeostatic regulation of blood glucose and systemic acid-base balance through renal gluconeogenesis regulation."

Ketogenic diet (KD) exerts beneficial effects in various diseases, but whether it could serve as non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KD on neointimal hyperplasia and the potential mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery balloon-injury model was employed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce neointimal hyperplasia. Then, animals were subjected to either standard rodent chow or KD. For in-vitro experiment, impacts of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the main mediator of KD effects, on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation were determined. Balloon injury induced event intimal hyperplasia and upregulation of protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and these changes were significantly ameliorated by KD. In addition, beta-HB could markedly inhibit PDGF-BB induced VMSC migration and proliferation, as well as inhibiting expressions of PCNA and alpha-SMC. Furthermore, KD inhibited balloon-injury induced oxidative stress in carotid artery, indicated by reduced ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We also found balloon-injury induced inflammation in carotid artery was suppressed by KD, indicated by decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: KD attenuates neointimal hyperplasia through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. KD may represent a promising non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia associated diseases."

Unexpectedly, insulin increased cardiac hydraulic work but decreased net glycolytic flux and O2 consumption, improving net cardiac efficiency by 28%. These improvements in physiologic performance and metabolic efficiency resulted from reduction of the mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] and oxidation of mitochondrial [coenzyme Q]/[coenzyme QH2], increasing the energy of the proton gradient between cytosolic and mitochondrial phases and leading to a doubling of the cytosolic free [sigmaATP]/[sigmaADP][sigmaPi]. The acute metabolic effects of insulin were qualitatively duplicated by addition of a ratio of 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and 1 mM acetoacetate, and the increase in the efficiency was the same as with addition of insulin. Addition of both insulin and ketones to the glucose perfusate increased the efficiency of cardiac hydraulic work by 35%. The ability of a physiologic ratio of ketone bodies to correct most of the metabolic defects of acute insulin deficiency suggests therapeutic roles for these natural substrates during periods of impaired cardiac performance and in insulin-resistant states.;In normoxic conditions, myocardial glucose utilization is inhibited when alternative oxidizable substrates are available. In this work we show that this inhibition is relieved in the presence of cAMP, and we studied the mechanism of this effect. Working rat hearts were perfused with 5.5 mM glucose alone (controls) or together with 5 mM lactate, 5 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate, or 1 mM palmitate. The effects of 0.1 mM chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), a cAMP analogue, were studied in each group. Glucose uptake, flux through 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity were inhibited in hearts perfused with alternative substrates, and addition of CPT-cAMP completely relieved the inhibition. The mechanism by which CPT-cAMP induced a preferential utilization of glucose was related to an increased glucose uptake and glycolysis, and to an activation of phosphorylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, the well-known stimulator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. In vitro phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased the Vmax of the enzyme and decreased its sensitivity to the inhibitor citrate. Therefore, in hearts perfused with various oxidizable substrates, cAMP induces a preferential utilization of glucose by a concerted stimulation of glucose transport, glycolysis, glycogen breakdown, and glucose oxidation."

However, these diets were designed to simulate a fasting state, thus, whether these effects are caused by diet-induced ketogenesis or persistent starvation is difficult to distinguish. The present study aimed to define the effects of a KD containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-KD) that increase blood ketone levels without inducing carbohydrate starvation, on circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. Mice were fed with a normal diet (CTRL) or MCT-KD for 2 weeks. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were significantly increased up to 2 mM by the MCT-KD, whereas body weight gain and blood glucose levels were identical between the groups, suggesting that ketosis accumulated without carbohydrate starvation in the MCT-KD mice. Circadian rhythms of wheel-running activity and core body temperature were almost identical, although wheel-running was slightly reduced in the MCT-KD mice. The circadian expression of the core clock genes, Per1, Per2, Bmal1, and Dbp in the hypothalamus, heart, liver, epididymal adipose tissues, and skeletal muscle were almost identical between the CTRL and MCT-KD mice, whereas the amplitude of hepatic Per2 and adipose Per1 expression was increased in MCT-KD mice. The MCT-KD reduced the duration of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep without affecting the duration of non-REM sleep and the duration of wakefulness. These findings suggested that the impact of ketone bodies on circadian systems are limited, although they might reduce locomotor activity and REM sleep duration."

However, these diets were designed to simulate a fasting state, thus, whether these effects are caused by diet-induced ketogenesis or persistent starvation is difficult to distinguish. The present study aimed to define the effects of a KD containing medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-KD) that increase blood ketone levels without inducing carbohydrate starvation, on circadian rhythms and sleep regulation. Mice were fed with a normal diet (CTRL) or MCT-KD for 2 weeks. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were significantly increased up to 2 mM by the MCT-KD, whereas body weight gain and blood glucose levels were identical between the groups, suggesting that ketosis accumulated without carbohydrate starvation in the MCT-KD mice.

However, the role of PES1 in regulating T2DM related lipid metabolism and the effect of ketogenic diet (KD) on PES1 have not been reported. The aim of present study is to explore the role of PES1 in effects of KD on diabetic mice and its mediated mechanism. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J and KKA(y) mice were fed with standard diet (SD) and KD, respectively. Simultaneously, McArdle 7777 cells were treated by beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-HB), Pes1 siRNA or Pes1 overexpression plasmid, respectively. Additionally, liver-conditional knockout (CKO) of Pes1 in vivo was applied. RESULTS: Hepatic PES1 expression in diabetic mice was markedly increased, which was suppressed by KD feeding with an accompanying reduction of hepatic and plasma triglycerides (TG). In mice with CKO of Pes1, the protein levels of p300, SREBP1c, FASN, SCD1, Caspase1, NLRP3 and GSDMD were dramatically downregulated in livers, and the plasma and hepatic TG, IL-1beta and IL-18 were decreased as well. The similar outcomes were also observed in beta-HB and Pes1 knockdown treated hepatocytes. By contrast, Pes1 overexpression in cultured hepatocytes showed that these levels were significantly enhanced, which were, however reduced under beta-HB treatment. Mechanistically, we discovered that beta-HB decreased CHOP binding to the Pes1 promoters, resulting in the downregulation of PES1, thereby reducing PES1 binding to p300 and Caspase1 promoters. The inhibition of p300 and Caspase1 expression elicited the dramatic suppression of acetylation of SREBP1c via its interaction with p300, and the decreased GSDMD levels. Besides, knockdown of Caspase1 also alleviated the TG levels in cultured hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: KD may improve lipid dysregulation in type 2 diabetic mice by downregulating hepatic PES1 expression."

The pathological process has not yet been clarified, although dysfunctional transport of Abeta across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) appears to be integral to disease development. At present, no effective therapeutic treatment against AD exists, and the adoption of a ketogenic diet (KD) or ketone body (KB) supplements have been investigated as potential new therapeutic approaches. Despite experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that KBs reduce the Abeta load in the AD brain, little information is available about the effect of KBs on BBB and their effect on Abeta transport. Therefore, we used a human in vitro BBB model, brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs), to investigate the effect of KBs on the BBB and on Abeta transport. Our results show that KBs do not modify BBB integrity and do not cause toxicity to BLECs. Furthermore, the presence of KBs in the culture media was combined with higher MCT1 and GLUT1 protein levels in BLECs. In addition, KBs significantly enhanced the protein levels of LRP1, P-gp, and PICALM, described to be involved in Abeta clearance. Finally, the combined use of KBs promotes Abeta efflux across the BBB. Inhibition experiments demonstrated the involvement of LRP1 and P-gp in the efflux. This work provides evidence that KBs promote Abeta clearance from the brain to blood in addition to exciting perspectives for studying the use of KBs in therapeutic approaches."

We have already shown that chronic exposure to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (OHB) decreases insulin-mediated activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. To gain further insights into the mechanism underlying ketone body-induced insulin resistance, we examined whether OHB alters activation of the insulin-signaling cascade and whether the insulinomimetic agent vanadate could bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in these cells. Cardiomyocytes were incubated with 5 mM OHB, 50 microM vanadate or both for 16 h before the measurement of glucose uptake or the activation of insulin-signaling molecules. While chronic exposure to OHB did not alter insulin- or vanadate-mediated activation of the insulin receptor, it suppressed insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation in response to both agonists. Furthermore, this treatment decreased by 54 and 36% the phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and PKB in response to insulin, whereas it did not alter vanadate-mediated activation of these enzymes. Although insulin did not significantly stimulate p38MAPK phosphorylation, vanadate increased it by 3.8-fold. Furthermore, chronic exposure to OHB potentiated vanadate's action, resulting in a 250% increase in enzyme activation compared to control cells. Though OHB induced a 2.1-fold increase of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, inhibition of this enzyme with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 demonstrated that ERK1/2 did not participate in OHB-induced insulin resistance. In conclusion, ketone bodies promote insulin resistance probably through decreased activation of the PI3-K/PKB signaling cascade. Furthermore, vanadate can bypass insulin resistance and stimulate glucose uptake in OHB-treated cardiomyocytes."

The ketogenic diet (KD) has been postulated to impede the advancement of various inflammatory ailments. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), a prominent constituent of ketone bodies, has recently been proposed to possess crucial signaling capabilities. In this study, we propose to explore the role and mechanism of betaOHB in OA. Tissue staining and inflammatory factor assay were employed to evaluate the impacts of KD and betaOHB on OA rats. The oxidative stress conditions in chondrocytes were induced using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The mechanisms were determined using the siRNA of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), the antagonist of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the inhibitor of mitophagy. The administration of KD demonstrated a reduction in pathological damage to cartilage, as well as a decrease in plasma levels of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, it resulted in an increase in the concentration of betaOHB in the blood and synovial fluid. In vitro experiments showed that betaOHB facilitated mitophagy and adenosine triphosphate production. Besides, betaOHB mitigated chondrocyte senescence, inflammatory factors secretion, extracellular matrix degradation, and apoptosis induced by TBHP. Subsequent investigations indicated that the protective effects of betaOHB were no longer observed following the knockdown of HCAR2, the antagonist of AMPK, or the inhibitor of mitophagy. Moreover, in vivo studies suggested that betaOHB played a protective role by targeting the HCAR2-AMPK-PINK1 axis. In conclusion, betaOHB enhanced chondrocyte mitophagy through the HCAR2/AMPK/PINK1/Parkin pathway, offering a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of OA."

Ketones, intermediates of lipid metabolism, have been proposed to mediate this change. Therefore, we investigated their direct effect on cultured pancreatic acinar cells and examined their possible interactive effects with glucose and dietary fat. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (0.01 to 2 mmol/L) did not affect lipase activity in cells isolated from rats fed a commercial nonpurified (NP) diet and cultured in high glucose (HG, 27.8 mmol/L) or low glucose (LG, 6.9 mmol/L) medium. The effects of ketones were also examined in acinar cells isolated from rats fed purified high fat (HF, 67% of energy from fat) or low fat (LF, 11% of energy from fat) diet. Cellular lipase was significantly higher in cells from HF-fed rats at both 24 and 48 h (264% and 145% of LF values, respectively, P less than 0.0001). beta-Hydroxybutyrate significantly increased (P less than 0.04) lipase activity in LF cells at 48 h but did not affect lipase activity in HF cells. These studies suggest that ketones may be involved in the regulation of pancreatic lipase in rats fed a LF diet, but their role is complex and interactive with dietary carbohydrate and fat."

However, the role of tanycytic GKRP and its impact on the regulation of feeding behavior has not been investigated. Here, we hypothesize that GKRP regulates feeding behavior by modulating tanycyte-neuron metabolic communication in the arcuate nucleus. Methods: We used primary cultures of tanycytes to evaluate the production of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB). Similarly, we examined the electrophysiological responses to these metabolites in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in hypothalamic slices. To evaluate the role of GKRP in feeding behavior, we generated tanycyte-selective GKRP-overexpressing and GKRP-knock down mice (GKRP(t)-OE and GKRP(t)-KD respectively) using adenovirus-mediated transduction. Results: We demonstrated that lactate release induced by glucose uptake is favored in GKRP-KD tanycytes. Conversely, tanycytes overexpressing GKRP showed an increase in betaHB efflux induced by low glucose concentration. In line with these findings, the excitability of POMC neurons was enhanced by lactate and decreased in the presence of betaHB. In GKRP(t)-OE rats, we found an increase in post-fasting food avidity, whereas GKRP(t)-KD caused a significant decrease in feeding and body weight, which is reverted when MCT1 is silenced. Conclusion: Our study highlights the role of tanycytic GKRP in metabolic regulation and positions this regulator of GK as a therapeutic target for boosting satiety in patients with obesity problems."

Exogenous supplementation of ketones also helps prevent heart failure (HF) development in rodent models, but whether ketones can be used to treat HF remains unexplored. Herein, we investigated whether chronic supplementation of ketones is beneficial for the heart in a mouse model of established HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: To elevate circulating ketone levels, we utilized (R)-3-hydroxybutyl-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate [ketone ester (KE)]. C57Bl/6N male mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. After developing HF, mice were treated with either 20% KE or vehicle via drinking water for 2 weeks. In another cohort, mice 3-4 weeks post-TAC received acute intravenous infusions of BHB or saline for 1 h and their cardiac function was measured. 20% KE significantly elevated blood BHB in mice (P < 0.01) without inducing ketoacidosis or altering other metabolic parameters. Mice with overt HF (30-45% ejection fraction) treated with 20% KE displayed significantly elevated circulating ketone levels compared with vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.05). The significant cardiac dysfunction in mice with HF continued to worsen after 2 weeks of vehicle treatment, whereas this decline was absent in KE-treated mice (mean difference 4.7% ejection fraction, P < 0.01). KE treatment also alleviated TAC-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (P < 0.05) and reduced the TAC-induced elevated cardiac periostin (P < 0.05), a marker of activated fibroblasts. Cardiac fibrosis was also significantly reduced with KE treatment in TAC mice (P < 0.01). In another cohort, acute BHB infusion significantly increased the cardiac output of mice with HF (P < 0.05), providing further support that ketone therapy can be used to treat HF. CONCLUSIONS: We show that chronic treatment of exogenous ketones is of benefit to the failing heart and that chronic ketone elevation may be a therapeutic option for HF. Further investigations to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) are warranted."

However, whether beta-HB alters the senescence pathway in vascular cells remains unknown. Here we report that beta-HB promotes vascular cell quiescence, which significantly inhibits both stress-induced premature senescence and replicative senescence through p53-independent mechanisms. Further, we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a direct binding target of beta-HB. beta-HB binding to hnRNP A1 markedly enhances hnRNP A1 binding with Octamer-binding transcriptional factor (Oct) 4 mRNA, which stabilizes Oct4 mRNA and Oct4 expression. Oct4 increases Lamin B1, a key factor against DNA damage-induced senescence. Finally, fasting and intraperitoneal injection of beta-HB upregulate Oct4 and Lamin B1 in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in mice in vivo. We conclude that beta-HB exerts anti-aging effects in vascular cells by upregulating an hnRNP A1-induced Oct4-mediated Lamin B1 pathway."

However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart.;Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) has been suggested as a contributing factor behind increased intestinal permeability in obesity, leading to increased plasma levels of microbial endotoxins and, thereby, increased systemic inflammation. We and others have shown that HFD can induce jejunal expression of the ketogenic rate-limiting enzyme mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS). HMGCS is activated via the free fatty acid binding nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha, and it is a key enzyme in ketone body synthesis that was earlier believed to be expressed exclusively in the liver. The function of intestinal ketogenesis is unknown but has been described in suckling rats and mice pups, possibly in order to allow large molecules, such as immunoglobulins, to pass over the intestinal barrier. Therefore, we hypothesized that ketone bodies could regulate intestinal barrier function, e.g., via regulation of tight junction proteins. The primary aim was to compare the effects of HFD that can induce intestinal ketogenesis to an equicaloric carbohydrate diet on inflammatory responses, nutrition sensing, and intestinal permeability in human jejunal mucosa. Fifteen healthy volunteers receiving a 2-week HFD diet compared to a high-carbohydrate diet were compared. Blood samples and mixed meal tests were performed at the end of each dietary period to examine inflammation markers and postprandial endotoxemia. Jejunal biopsies were assessed for protein expression using Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and morphometric characteristics of tight junctions by electron microscopy. Functional analyses of permeability and ketogenesis were performed in Caco-2 cells, mice, and human enteroids. Ussing chambers were used to analyze permeability. CRP and ALP values were within normal ranges and postprandial endotoxemia levels were low and did not differ between the two diets. The PPARalpha receptor was ketone body-dependently reduced after HFD. None of the tight junction proteins studied, nor the basal electrical parameters, were different between the two diets. However, the ketone body inhibitor hymeglusin increased resistance in mucosal biopsies. In addition, the tight junction protein claudin-3 was increased by ketone inhibition in human enteroids. The ketone body beta-Hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) did not, however, change the mucosal transition of the large-size molecular FD4-probe or LPS in Caco-2 and mouse experiments. We found that PPARalpha expression was inhibited by the ketone body betaHB. As PPARalpha regulates HMGCS expression, the ketone bodies thus exert negative feedback signaling on their own production. Furthermore, ketone bodies were involved in the regulation of permeability on intestinal mucosal cells in vitro and ex vivo. We were not, however, able to reproduce these effects on intestinal permeability in vivo in humans when comparing two weeks of high-fat with high-carbohydrate diet in healthy volunteers. Further, neither the expression of inflammation markers nor the aggregate tight junction proteins were changed. Thus, it seems that not only HFD but also other factors are needed to permit increased intestinal permeability in vivo. This indicates that the healthy gut can adapt to extremes of macro-nutrients and increased levels of intestinally produced ketone bodies, at least during a shorter dietary challenge."

However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is highly induced in WAT and has been implicated in lipid metabolism. Here, we show that ApoE deficiency in mice increased oxygen consumption and thermogenesis and enhanced adipose browning pattern in inguinal WAT (iWAT), with associated characteristics such as increased Ucp1 and Ppargamma expression. At the cellular level, ApoE deficient beige adipocytes had increased glucose uptake and higher mitochondrial respiration than wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we showed that ApoE deficient iWAT and primary adipose precursor cells activated the thermogenic genes program by stimulating the production of ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a novel adipose browning promoting factor. This was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in ketogenesis and could be compromised by the treatment for ketogenesis inhibitors. Consistently, ApoE deficient mice show higher serum betaHB level than wild-type mice in the fed state and during cold exposure. Our results further demonstrate that the increased betaHB production in ApoE deficient adipose precursor cells could be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced Cd36 expression and CD36-mediated fatty acid utilization. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized role for ApoE in energy homeostasis via its cell-autonomous action in WAT.;Liver can sense the nutrient status and send signals to other organs to regulate overall metabolic homoeostasis. Herein, we demonstrate that ketone bodies act as signals released from the liver that specifically determine the distribution of excess lipid in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) when exposed to a ketogenic diet (KD). An acute KD can immediately result in excess lipid deposition in the liver. Subsequently, the liver sends the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) to regulate white adipose expansion, including adipogenesis and lipogenesis, to alleviate hepatic lipid accumulation. When ketone bodies are depleted by deleting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 gene in the liver, the enhanced lipid deposition in eWAT but not in inguinal white adipose tissue is preferentially blocked, while lipid accumulation in liver is not alleviated. Mechanistically, ketone body BHB can significantly decrease lysine acetylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in eWAT, causing enhanced activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, the key adipogenic transcription factor. These observations suggest that the liver senses metabolic stress first and sends a corresponding signal, that is, ketone body BHB, to specifically promote eWAT expansion to adapt to metabolic challenges."

We used mice inducibly expressing a mutated form of the mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme UNG1 (mutUNG1) to cause progressive mitochondrial dysfunction selectively in forebrain neurons. We examined the levels of mRNAs and proteins crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. We show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons in mutUNG1 mice, as well as cultured rat hippocampal neurons and human fibroblasts with H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress, improve markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function when fed on a KD, and when exposed to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, by upregulating PGC1alpha, SIRT3 and UCP2, and (in cultured cells) increasing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The mitochondrial level of UCP2 was significantly higher in the perikarya and axon terminals of hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in KD treated mutUNG1 mice compared with mutUNG1 mice fed a standard diet. The beta-hydroxybutyrate receptor GPR109a (HCAR2), but not the structurally closely related lactate receptor GPR81 (HCAR1), was upregulated in mutUNG1 mice on a KD, suggesting a selective influence of KD on ketone body receptor mechanisms. We conclude that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in mutUNG1 expressing mice causes oxidative stress, and that exposure of animals to KD, or of cells to ketone body in vitro, elicits compensatory mechanisms acting to augment mitochondrial mass and bioenergetics via the PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 axis (The compensatory processes are overwhelmed in the mutUNG1 mice by all the newly formed mitochondria being dysfunctional).;Glycogen has long been considered to have a function in energy metabolism. However, our recent study indicated that glycogen metabolism, directed by cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Pck1, controls the formation and maintenance of CD8(+) memory T (T(mem)) cells by regulating redox homeostasis(1). This unusual metabolic program raises the question of how Pck1 is upregulated in CD8(+) T(mem) cells. Here, we show that mitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A is diverted to the ketogenesis pathway, which indirectly regulates Pck1 expression. Mechanistically, ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate is present in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, beta-hydroxybutyrate epigenetically modifies Lys 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) of Foxo1 and Ppargc1a (which encodes PGC-1alpha) with beta-hydroxybutyrylation, upregulating the expression of these genes. As a result, FoxO1 and PGC-1alpha cooperatively upregulate Pck1 expression, therefore directing the carbon flow along the gluconeogenic pathway to glycogen and the pentose phosphate pathway. These results reveal that ketogenesis acts as an unusual metabolic pathway in CD8(+) T(mem) cells, linking epigenetic modification required for memory development.;Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) have been proposed to mediate systemic metabolic response to fasting. However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart.;Ischemic cardiac disease is a major cause of mortality worldwide. However, the exact molecular processes underlying this disorder are not fully known. This study includes a comprehensive and coordinated set of in vivo and in vitro experiments using human cardiac specimens from patients with postischemic heart failure (HF) and healthy control subjects, a murine model of HF, and cellular systems. These approaches identified for the first time a specific pattern of maladaptive chromatin remodeling, namely a double methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 and a single methylation at lysine 36 (H3_K27me2K36me1) consistently induced by ischemic injury in all these settings: human HF, murine HF, and in vitro models. Mechanistically, this work demonstrates that this histone modification mediates the ischemia-induced transcriptional repression of PPARG coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha), master regulator of mitochondrial function and biogenesis. Intriguingly, both the augmented H3_K27me2K36me1 and the mitochondrial dysfunction ensued by PGC1alpha down-regulation were significantly attenuated by the treatment with beta-hydroxybutyrate, the most abundant ketone body in humans, revealing a novel pathway coupling metabolism to gene expression. Taken together, these findings establish maladaptive chromatin remodeling as a key mechanism in postischemic heart injury, functionally modulated by ketone bodies.;AIM: To investigate the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and melatonin on brown adipose tissue (BAT) plasticity in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS: We employed a 7-week experimental design for a study on 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into five groups: (1) a control-diet fed group, (2) a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed group, (3) a group that received an HFD and a BHB solution in their drinking water, (4) a group that received an HFD with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin in their drinking water, and (5) a group that received an HFD and were also treated with the combination of BHB and melatonin. Following the treatment period, biochemical indices, gene expression levels of key thermogenic markers (including uncoupling protein 1 [UCP1], PR domain containing 16 [PRDM16], Cidea, fat-specific protein 27 [Fsp27], and metallothionein 1 [MT1]), and stereological assessments of BAT were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with BHB and melatonin significantly boosted blood ketone levels, improved lipid profiles, and reduced weight gain from an HFD. It also downregulated genes linked to WAT, namely, Cidea and Fsp27, and upregulated key BAT markers, including UCP1, PRDM16 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha. Additionally, the co-treatment increased MT1 receptor expression and enhanced the structural density of BAT. CONCLUSION: The combined oral administration of BHB and melatonin successfully prevented the whitening of BAT in obese rats fed an HFD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related BAT dysfunction. The synergistic effects of this treatment underscore the potential of a combined approach to address BAT dysfunction in obesity.;One of the therapeutic approaches to age-related diseases is modulation of body cell metabolism through certain diets or their pharmacological mimetics. The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

We investigated the roles of a single bout of aerobic exercise that increases lactate and beta-HB levels in the fasted state on the regulation of fat browning in rats and humans. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 24-h fasting and/or a single bout moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (40 min): sedentary (CON), exercise (ND-EX), fasting (FAST), and exercise + fasting (F-EX). Adult men ( n = 13) were randomly assigned into control with food intake (CON), exercise with intensity at onset of blood lactate accumulation in the fasted state (F-OBLA), and high-intensity interval exercise in the fasted state (F-HIIE) until each participant expended 350 kcal of energy. For evaluating the effects of exercise intensity in rats, we conducted another set of animal experiment, including groups of sedentary fed control, fasting control, and exercise with moderate-intensity or HIIE for 40 min after a 24-h fasting. RESULTS: Regardless of fasting, single bout of exercise increases the concentration of lactate and beta-HB in rats, but the exercise in the fasted state increases the beta-HB level more significantly in rats and humans. F-EX-activated fat browning (AMPK-SirT1-PGC1alpha pathway and PRDM16) and thermogenic factor (UCP1) in white fat of rats. In rats and humans, exercise in the fasted state increased the blood levels of fat browning-related adipomyokines. In particular, compared with F-OBLA, F-HIIE more efficiently increases free fatty acid as well as blood levels of fat browning adipomyokines in humans, which was correlated with blood levels of lactate and beta-HB. In rats that performed exercise with different intensity, the higher plasma lactate and beta-HB levels, and higher expression of p-AMPK, UCP1, and PRDM16 in white adipose tissue of HIIE group than those of moderate-intensity group, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A single bout of aerobic exercise in the fasted state significantly induced fat browning-related pathways, free fatty acid, and adipomyokines, particularly F-HIIE in human. Although further evidence for supporting our results is required in humans, aerobic exercise in the fasted state with high intensity that increase lactate and beta-HB may be a modality of fat browning.;AIM: To investigate the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and melatonin on brown adipose tissue (BAT) plasticity in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS: We employed a 7-week experimental design for a study on 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into five groups: (1) a control-diet fed group, (2) a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed group, (3) a group that received an HFD and a BHB solution in their drinking water, (4) a group that received an HFD with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin in their drinking water, and (5) a group that received an HFD and were also treated with the combination of BHB and melatonin. Following the treatment period, biochemical indices, gene expression levels of key thermogenic markers (including uncoupling protein 1 [UCP1], PR domain containing 16 [PRDM16], Cidea, fat-specific protein 27 [Fsp27], and metallothionein 1 [MT1]), and stereological assessments of BAT were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with BHB and melatonin significantly boosted blood ketone levels, improved lipid profiles, and reduced weight gain from an HFD. It also downregulated genes linked to WAT, namely, Cidea and Fsp27, and upregulated key BAT markers, including UCP1, PRDM16 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha. Additionally, the co-treatment increased MT1 receptor expression and enhanced the structural density of BAT. CONCLUSION: The combined oral administration of BHB and melatonin successfully prevented the whitening of BAT in obese rats fed an HFD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related BAT dysfunction. The synergistic effects of this treatment underscore the potential of a combined approach to address BAT dysfunction in obesity.;INTRODUCTION: Despite evidence suggesting that metabolic intermediates like beta-HB influence white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolism, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) on the fat browning program and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models. We assessed the effects of beta-HB on fat browning in adipocytes using 3T3-L1 cells and rat models. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of beta-HB on fat browning, thermogenesis, lipid accumulation, adipokine expression, and mitochondrial biogenesis by treating mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with sodium beta-HB for 24 h or by continuously exposing preadipocytes to beta-HB during the 8-day differentiation process. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, exercise only (EX), ketogenic diet only (KD), and combined exercise and ketogenic diet (KE) groups for an 8-week intervention involving diet and/or exercise. After intervention, we evaluated WAT histology, plasma lipids and adipokines, and the expression of markers related to fat browning, thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT of rats. RESULTS: In our adipocyte culture experiments, beta-HB reduced intracellular lipid accumulation by enhancing lipolysis and stimulated the expression of thermogenic and fat browning genes like uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and adipokines such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FDNC5). Additionally, beta-HB activated the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway, with UCP1 and PRDM16 upregulation mediated by beta-HB intracellular action and SIRT1 activity. In animal experiments, KE group raised beta-HB levels, decreasing body weight and blood lipids. KD with EX promoted WAT browning possibly via AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha, augmenting PRDM16, UCP1, FGF21, and FNDC5 expression. CONCLUSION: beta-HB induction via KD and/or EX shows potential in promoting WAT browning by activating mitochondrial biogenesis, lipolysis, and thermogenesis, suggesting that dietary and physical intervention inducing beta-HB may benefit metabolic health."

However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart."

Mice were divided into 5 groups: control, heat-stressed, HT-ac, HBET, and HT-ac + HBET. Mice were gavaged for 21 days and exposed to heat (42.5 +/- 0.5  degrees C, RH 60 +/- 10%, 1 h day(-1)) on days 15-21, except for the control group. Results showed that the combination of HT-ac + HBET improved the cognitive and learning abilities of heat-stressed mice, which were tested by Morris water maze, shuttle box, and jumping stage tests. The combination of HT-ac + HBET maintained the integrity of neurons and mitochondria of heat-stressed mice. Likewise, this combination increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, the ATP content, the expression of phosphorylated PKA, BDNF, phosphorylated CREB and Bcl-2, and decreased the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and intracytoplasmic Cyt C in heat-stressed mice."

However, alleviating OA progression through senescent chondrocyte intervention still faces great challenges. beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exhibits anti-senescence effects in a variety of age-related dis-eases, but its role in osteoarthritis remains poorly understood. To explore the molecular mechanisms, gene sequencing was used to identify critical genes and potential cellular signaling pathways and male SD rats were used to generate an osteoarthritis model. Results showed that BHB attenuated the senescence of Osteoarthritis chondrocytes (OA-Chos) and alleviated OA progression. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed significant changes in cell cycle genes, with PTEN being the most significant differentially expressed gene. BHB up-regulated the expression of PTEN in OA-Chos, thereby alleviating chondrocyte senescence. Furthermore, BHB facilitated the expression of PTEN by binding to hnRNP A1 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt. This study provided evidence that BHB mitigated chondrocyte senescence and delayed OA, and could thus be used as a novel therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis treatment."
ENSG00000081237,PTPRC,0.5578408,weak,1,39763881,2024,Kidney,The ketone body beta-Hydroxybutyrate mediated epigenetic chromatin beta-hydroxybutyrylation protects kidneys.,"Starvation, intermittent fasting and exercise, all of which are recommended lifestyle modifiers share a common metabolic signature, ketogenesis to generate the ketone bodies, predominantly beta-hydroxybutyrate. beta-hydroxybutyrate exerts beneficial effects across various contexts, preventing or mitigating disease. We hypothesized that these dynamic health benefits of beta-hydroxybutyrate might stem from its ability to regulate genome architecture through chromatin remodeling via histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, thereby influencing the transcriptome. Focusing on the kidney, which is an end organ protected by beta-hydroxybutyrate, we examined histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation-mediated chromatin remodeling. Notably, regions of the genome associated with lipid catabolism were predominantly in an open chromatin configuration, leading to active transcription and translation. Significant beta-hydroxybutyrylation was observed in the kidneys and the most highly upregulated gene actively transcribed and translated was 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl CoA Synthase 2 ( Hmgcs2 ), a gene responsible for the biosynthesis of beta-hydroxybutyrate in mitochondria. In contrast, regions with more compact chromatin structures were enriched with genes related to immune function such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C ( Ptprc ) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 ( Lcp1 ), which exhibited reduced transcription and translation. These results reveal that renal epigenetic histone beta-hydroxybutyrylation, which concurrently modulates both energy metabolism and immune function is a mechanism underlying the dynamic health effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate to protect kidneys and lower hypertension."

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome."

In this work we show that this inhibition is relieved in the presence of cAMP, and we studied the mechanism of this effect. Working rat hearts were perfused with 5.5 mM glucose alone (controls) or together with 5 mM lactate, 5 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate, or 1 mM palmitate. The effects of 0.1 mM chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), a cAMP analogue, were studied in each group. Glucose uptake, flux through 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity were inhibited in hearts perfused with alternative substrates, and addition of CPT-cAMP completely relieved the inhibition. The mechanism by which CPT-cAMP induced a preferential utilization of glucose was related to an increased glucose uptake and glycolysis, and to an activation of phosphorylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, the well-known stimulator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. In vitro phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased the Vmax of the enzyme and decreased its sensitivity to the inhibitor citrate. Therefore, in hearts perfused with various oxidizable substrates, cAMP induces a preferential utilization of glucose by a concerted stimulation of glucose transport, glycolysis, glycogen breakdown, and glucose oxidation."

Although weight loss on a ketogenic diet may be associated with decreased appetite and altered gut hormone levels, it is unknown whether such changes are caused by elevated blood ketones. This study investigated the effects of an exogenous ketone ester (KE) on appetite. METHODS: Following an overnight fast, subjects with normal weight (n = 15) consumed 1.9 kcal/kg of KE, or isocaloric dextrose (DEXT), in drinks matched for volume, taste, tonicity, and color. Blood samples were analyzed for BHB, glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and a three-measure visual analogue scale was used to measure hunger, fullness, and desire to eat. RESULTS: KE consumption increased blood BHB levels from 0.2 to 3.3 mM after 60 minutes. DEXT consumption increased plasma glucose levels between 30 and 60 minutes. Postprandial plasma insulin, ghrelin, GLP-1, and PYY levels were significantly lower 2 to 4 hours after KE consumption, compared with DEXT consumption. Temporally related to the observed suppression of ghrelin, reported hunger and desire to eat were also significantly suppressed 1.5 hours after consumption of KE, compared with consumption of DEXT. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood ketone levels may directly suppress appetite, as KE drinks lowered plasma ghrelin levels, perceived hunger, and desire to eat.;OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the degree of ketosis, measured as plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) in fasting, was associated with changes in appetite feelings and plasma concentration of appetite-related hormones after weight loss. METHODS: A total of 87 individuals with obesity (BMI: 36.5 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2) , age: 42.4 +/- 9.7 years, 39 males) underwent 8 weeks of a very low-energy diet. Body weight/composition, plasma concentration of betaHB, and appetite-related hormones (active ghrelin, active glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1], total peptide YY, cholecystokinin [CCK], and insulin) and subjective appetite feelings were measured at baseline and week 9. RESULTS: Participants lost 17.7 +/- 4.1 kg and were ketotic (betaHB: 1.24 +/- 0.82 mmol/L in fasting) at week 9. A negative association was found between betaHB in fasting at week 9 and changes in basal (r = -0.315, P = 0.003) and postprandial ghrelin concentration (r = -0.286, P = 0.008), and a positive association was found with the change in postprandial GLP-1 (r = 0.244, P = 0.025) and CCK (r = 0.228, P = 0.035). No association was seen between betaHB in fasting and changes in peptide YY or subjective feelings of appetite. CONCLUSIONS: betaHB plasma concentration in fasting is associated with lower concentrations of the hunger hormone ghrelin and increased concentrations of the satiety hormones GLP-1 and CCK. Future studies should explore the molecular mechanisms by which betaHB modulates the secretion of gut hormones.;SCOPE: The main aim of the present study is to study the effect of acute ketosis on parameters of appetite regulation in prediabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a randomized controlled trial registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03889210. After an overnight fast, 18 adults with prediabetes are assigned to consume a ketone monoester (d-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol) drink and a placebo drink in cross-over fashion. Blood samples are collected every 30 min, from baseline to 150 min. Paired t test is used to compare the total area under the curve (AUC) for the changes in parameters of appetite regulation (acylated ghrelin, peptide YY [PYY], and hunger) following both drinks. Significant elevation in blood beta-hydroxybutyrate from 0.2 to 3.5 mmol L(-1) (p < 0.001) is achieved within 30 min. Acute ketosis does not result in statistically significant differences in the AUCs for ghrelin, PYY, and hunger. CONCLUSION: Acute ketosis consistently does not affect both objective and subjective parameters of appetite regulation in prediabetes."

Apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) is strongly associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect of beta-OHB in the brain and the aorta of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE-deficient mice. We found in Apo-E deficient mice that beta-OHB attenuated lipid deposition in the choroid plexus (ChP) and decreased amyloid plaque in the substantia nigra pars compacta. We also found decreased CD68-positive macroglia infiltration of the ChP in beta-OHB-treated ApoE-deficient mice. beta-OHB treatment ameliorated IgG extravasation into the hippocampal region of the brain. In vitro study using ChP mice cell line revealed that beta-OHB attenuated oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced ApoE-specific differentially expressed inflammatory ChP genes. Treatment with beta-OHB reduced aortic plaque formation without affecting blood lipid profiles and decreased serum production of resistin, a well-established risk factor for both AD and atherosclerosis. Thus, the current study suggests and describes the therapeutic potential of beta-OHB for the treatment of AD and atherosclerosis."

Ketone bodies are comprised of three compounds (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) that circulate during starvation, especially during prolonged starvation. Here we have investigated the hypothesis that ketone bodies induce CMA. We found that physiological concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum and without serum, however, acetoacetate only induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum. Lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells displayed an increased ability to degrade both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A, substrates for CMA. Isolated lysosomes from cells maintained in media without serum also demonstrated an increased ability to degrade glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A when the reaction was supplemented with BOH. Such treatment did not affect the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a or lysosomal heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa, two rate-limiting proteins in CMA. However, pretreatment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and ribonuclease A with BOH increased their rate of degradation by isolated lysosomes. Lysosomes pretreated with BOH showed no increase in proteolysis, suggesting that BOH acts on the substrates to increase their rates of proteolysis. Using OxyBlot analysis to detect carbonyl formation on proteins, one common marker of protein oxidation, we showed that treatment of substrates with BOH increased their oxidation. Neither glycerol, another compound that increases in circulation during prolonged starvation, nor butanol or butanone, compounds closely related to BOH, had an effect on CMA. The induction of CMA by ketone bodies may provide an important physiological mechanism for the activation of CMA during prolonged starvation."

These cells express receptors and transporters for neurotransmitters, including GABA. GABA signaling is reportedly able to affect astroglial response to injury, as evaluated by specific astrocyte markers such as glial fibrillary acid protein and the calcium-binding protein, S100B. Herein, we investigated the modulatory effects of the GABA(A) receptor on astrocyte S100B secretion in acute hippocampal slices and astrocyte cultures, using the agonist, muscimol, and the antagonists pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and bicuculline. These effects were analyzed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), fluorocitrate (FLC), cobalt and barium. PTZ positively modify S100B secretion in hippocampal slices and astrocyte cultures, in contrast, bicuculline inhibited S100B secretion only in hippocampal slices. Muscimol, per se, did not change S100B secretion, but prevented the effects of PTZ and bicuculline. Moreover, PTZ-induced S100B secretion was prevented by TTX, FLC, cobalt and barium indicating a complex GABA(A) communication between astrocytes and neurons. The effects of two putative agonists of GABA(A), beta-hydroxybutyrate and methylglyoxal, on S100B secretion were also evaluated. In view of the neurotrophic role of extracellular S100B under conditions of injury, our data reinforce the idea that GABA(A) receptors act directly on astrocytes, and indirectly on neurons, to modulate astroglial response."

In recent years, unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., sedentary lifestyles) have contributed to a worldwide epidemic of atherosclerosis. Exercise is a known treatment of atherosclerosis, but the precise mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show that 12 weeks of regular exercise training on a treadmill significantly decreased lipid accumulation and foam cell formation in ApoE(-/-) mice fed with a Western diet, which plays a critical role in the process of atherosclerosis. This was associated with an increase in beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) levels in the serum. We provide evidence that BHB treatment in vivo or in vitro increases the protein levels of cholesterol transporters, including ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI, and is capable of reducing lipid accumulation. It also ameliorated autophagy in macrophages and atherosclerosis plaques, which play an important role in the step of cholesterol efflux. Altogether, an increase in serum BHB levels after regular exercise is an important mechanism of exercise inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis. This provides a novel treatment for atherosclerotic patients who are unable to undertake regular exercise for whatever reason. They will gain a benefit from receiving additional BHB."

Type 1 diabetes is associated with elevated levels of blood PAI-1 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence. However, type 1 diabetic patients have elevated blood levels of ketone bodies acetoacetate (AA) and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). This study examined the hypothesis that hyperketonemia (ketosis) contributes to increased secretion of PAI-1 from the cells that form the vascular endothelium. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with different concentrations of AA or BHB in the presence or absence of high glucose (HG) and the amount of PAI-1 protein secreted by these cells into conditioned media was determined. Levels of PAI-1 secreted into conditioned media by these treated cells did not change significantly when compared to controls. High glucose induced a significant increase in PAI-1 secretion, but combination with AA or BHB did not cause significant effects on PAI-1 secretion caused by HG. These results indicate that hyperglycemia but not hyperketonemia is a significant contributor to increased blood levels of PAI-1 associated with type 1 diabetes."

Since dietary interventions can alter neurodegenerative processes, Csb(m/m) mice were given a high-fat, caloric-restricted, or resveratrol-supplemented diet. High-fat feeding rescued the metabolic, transcriptomic, and behavioral phenotypes of Csb(m/m) mice. Furthermore, premature aging in CS mice, nematodes, and human cells results from aberrant PARP activation due to deficient DNA repair leading to decreased SIRT1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are increased by the high-fat diet, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, PARP inhibition, or NAD(+) supplementation can activate SIRT1 and rescue CS-associated phenotypes. Mechanistically, CSB can displace activated PARP1 from damaged DNA to limit its activity. This study connects two emerging longevity metabolites, beta-hydroxybutyrate and NAD(+), through the deacetylase SIRT1 and suggests possible interventions for CS.;Learning and memory impairment is a common clinical symptom of aging and nervous system injuries, and seriously affects quality of life. Memory impairment is associated with increased oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory response. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) is a water-soluble endogenous small-molecule ketone body that easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and has shown neuroprotection activities. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of BHBA on D-galactose (D-gal)-induced memory impairment in mice by in vitro and in vivo experiments. BHBA was administered intragastrically to D-gal-injured C57BL/6 mice for 42 days. Water maze performance, the morphology of the hippocampus with Nissl staining, the ACh content, OS, and inflammation status were examined. To further investigate the mechanism, hippocampal neuronal cells (HT22) were treated with BHBA with or without the SIRT1 inhibitor or small interfering RNAs against sirt1 (si-SIRT1) before incubation with D-gal. BHBA significantly improved water maze performance, increased the ACh content, SOD activity, and SIRT1 expression, and decreased AChE and LDH activity, ROS, MDA, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha contents, and NLRP3 expression. Further studies with the SIRT inhibitor or siRNAs against sirt1 reversed the above effects of BHBA. Collectively, BHBA inhibited hippocampal OS and the inflammation process to alleviate learning and memory impairment through activating the SIRT1 pathway in D-gal-injured mice, suggesting that BHBA could be a potential option for drug development of learning and memory impairment induced by nervous system injuries."

The ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), is metabolized to acetyl-CoA in brain mitochondria and used as an energy fuel alternative to glucose. We have previously reported that D-BHB sustains ATP production and stimulates the autophagic flux under glucose deprivation in neurons, however, the effects of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover under physiological conditions are still unknown. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD(+)-activated protein deacetylases involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy through the activation of transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3a, TFEB and PGC1alpha coactivator. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover in cultured neurons and the mechanisms involved. Results show that D-BHB increased mitochondrial membrane potential and regulated the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. D-BHB enhanced FOXO1, FOXO3a and PGC1alpha nuclear levels in an SIRT2-dependent manner and stimulated autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects increased neuronal resistance to energy stress. D-BHB also stimulated the autophagic-lysosomal pathway through AMPK activation and TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis. Upregulation of SIRT2, FOXOs, PGC1alpha and TFEB was confirmed in the brain of ketogenic diet (KD)-treated mice. Altogether, the results identify SIRT2, for the first time, as a target of D-BHB in neurons, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control."

Growing evidence indicates that ketone bodies have beneficial effects in treating stroke, but their underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study showed ketone bodies reduced reactive oxygen species by using NADH as an electron donor, thus increasing the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. In this study, we investigated whether mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) could mediate the neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies after ischemic stroke. We injected mice with either normal saline or ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) at 30 minutes after ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We found that ketone treatment enhanced mitochondria function, reduced oxidative stress, and therefore reduced infarct volume. This led to improved neurologic function after ischemia, including the neurologic score and the performance in Rotarod and open field tests. We further showed that ketones' effects were achieved by upregulating NAD(+)-dependent SIRT3 and its downstream substrates forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the penumbra region since knocking down SIRT3 in vitro diminished ketones' beneficial effects. These results provide us a foundation to develop novel therapeutics targeting this SIRT3-FoxO3a-SOD2 pathway.;A ketogenic diet (KD, high-fat, low-carbohydrate) can benefit refractory epilepsy, but underlying mechanisms are unknown. We used mice inducibly expressing a mutated form of the mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme UNG1 (mutUNG1) to cause progressive mitochondrial dysfunction selectively in forebrain neurons. We examined the levels of mRNAs and proteins crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. We show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons in mutUNG1 mice, as well as cultured rat hippocampal neurons and human fibroblasts with H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress, improve markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function when fed on a KD, and when exposed to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, by upregulating PGC1alpha, SIRT3 and UCP2, and (in cultured cells) increasing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The mitochondrial level of UCP2 was significantly higher in the perikarya and axon terminals of hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in KD treated mutUNG1 mice compared with mutUNG1 mice fed a standard diet. The beta-hydroxybutyrate receptor GPR109a (HCAR2), but not the structurally closely related lactate receptor GPR81 (HCAR1), was upregulated in mutUNG1 mice on a KD, suggesting a selective influence of KD on ketone body receptor mechanisms. We conclude that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in mutUNG1 expressing mice causes oxidative stress, and that exposure of animals to KD, or of cells to ketone body in vitro, elicits compensatory mechanisms acting to augment mitochondrial mass and bioenergetics via the PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 axis (The compensatory processes are overwhelmed in the mutUNG1 mice by all the newly formed mitochondria being dysfunctional).;The mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiac events in diabetic patients remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on the acute survival rate after myocardial infarction (MI) in an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and the possible involvement of modification of cardiac metabolomes and antioxidative proteins. MI was induced in DM Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats. Treatment with empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day, 14 days) before MI reduced blood glucose and increased blood and myocardial beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) levels in OLETF. Survival rate at 48 hours after MI was significantly lower in OLETF rats than in LETO rats (40% vs. 84%), and empagliflozin significantly improved the survival rate in OLETF rats to 70%, although the sizes of MI were comparable. Patterns of metabolomes and gene expression in the noninfarcted myocardium of OLETF rats were consistent with increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation. The patterns were modified by empagliflozin, suggesting both increased glucose oxidation and ketone utilization in OLETF rats. Empagliflozin prevented reduction of ATP level in the noninfarcted myocardium after MI and significantly increased myocardial levels of Sirt3 and superoxide dismutase 2 in OLETF rats. Administration of betaOHB partially mimicked the effects of empagliflozin in OLETF rats. The results suggest that empagliflozin prevents DM-induced increase in post-MI mortality, possibly by protective modification of cardiac energy metabolism and antioxidant proteins.;BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE4 carriers have cerebral hypometabolism which is thought as a harbinger of AD. Our previous studies indicated ketones improved mitochondria energy metabolism via sirtuin 3 (Sirt3). However, it is unclear whether ketones upregulate Sirt3 and improve ApoE4-related learning and memory deficits. RESULTS: Ketones improved learning and memory abilities of ApoE4 mice but not ApoE3 mice. Sirt3, synaptic proteins, the NAD(+)/ NADH ratio, and ATP production were significantly increased in the hippocampus and the cortex from ketone treatment. METHODS: Human ApoE3 and ApoE4 transgenic mice (9-month-old) were treated with either ketones or normal saline by daily subcutaneous injections for 3 months (ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB): 600 mg/kg/day, acetoacetate (ACA): 150 mg/kg/day). Learning and memory ability of these mice were assessed. Sirt3 protein, synaptic proteins (PSD95, Synaptophysin), the NAD(+)/ NADH ratio, and ATP levels were measured in the hippocampus and the cortex. CONCLUSION: Our current studies suggest that ketones improve learning and memory abilities of ApoE4 transgenic mice. Sirt3 may mediate the neuroprotection of ketones by increasing neuronal energy metabolism in ApoE4 transgenic mice. This provides the foundation for Sirt3's potential role in the prevention and treatment of AD."

However, the metabolic/cell biologic mechanisms by which the KD exerts its antiepileptic efficacy remain elusive. Herein, we report that KD-produced beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) augments brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit epilepsy. The KD ameliorated pentetrazol-induced epilepsy in mice. Mechanistically, KD-produced BHB, but not other ketone bodies, inhibited HDAC1/HDAC2, increased H3K27 acetylation, and transcriptionally upregulated SIRT4 and glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1). BHB-induced SIRT4 de-carbamylated and inactivated glutamate dehydrogenase to preserve glutamate for GABA synthesis, and GAD1 upregulation increased mouse brain GABA/glutamate ratio to inhibit neuron excitation. BHB administration in mice inhibited epilepsy induced by pentetrazol. BHB-mediated relief of epilepsy required high GABA level and GABA/glutamate ratio. These results identified BHB as the major antiepileptic metabolite of the KD and suggested that BHB may serve as an alternative and less toxic antiepileptic agent than KD."

Herein, we reported that prolonged KD exposure induced cardiac fibrosis. In rats, KD or frequent deep fasting decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, reduced cell respiration, and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Mechanistically, increased levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), an HDAC2 inhibitor, promoted histone acetylation of the Sirt7 promoter and activated Sirt7 transcription. This in turn inhibited the transcription of mitochondrial ribosome-encoding genes and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis. Exogenous beta-OHB administration mimicked the effects of a KD in rats. Notably, increased beta-OHB levels and SIRT7 expression, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased cardiac fibrosis were detected in human atrial fibrillation heart tissues. Our results highlighted the unknown detrimental effects of KDs and provided insights into strategies for preventing cardiac fibrosis in patients for whom KDs are medically necessary."

Previous studies have shown that the Na-K-Cl cotransporter of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes is a major participant in ischemia-induced cerebral edema in stroke. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the Na-K-Cl cotransporter also contributes to cerebral edema in DKA. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered streptozotocin to induce DKA, and then cerebral edema was assessed by determination of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) with magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging. Cerebral ADC values in DKA rats were significantly reduced in both cortex and striatum compared with non-DKA control rats, indicating the presence of cerebral edema. Intravenous administration of bumetanide to DKA rats abolished the drop in cortical ADC values, while having no significant effect in the striatum. Insulin and saline treatment had no effect when given after bumetanide but increased both cortical and striatal ADC values when given before bumetanide. Evidence is also presented here that acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate stimulate brain microvascular Na-K-Cl cotransporter activity. These findings suggest that the Na-K-Cl cotransporter contributes to brain edema in DKA."

Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).;Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability worldwide, unfortunately, no drugs are clinically available to promote functional recovery after stroke. Although animal environmental enrichment is a recognized paradigm for promoting stroke repair, elusive mechanisms hinder its clinical translation. Here, we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) level in the peri-infarct cortex is upregulated after environmental enrichment (EE) exposure. Importantly, exogenous supplementation of beta-HB promotes functional recovery to a similar extent as EE exposure. Moreover, the beneficial effects of EE on stroke recovery, including functional recovery, neuroplasticity-related proteins upregulation, and structural and functional plasticity enhancement, are abolished by beta-HB transporter inhibitor, AR-C155858. Intriguingly, supplementation with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-beta-HB, a ketone ester (KE), substantially increases beta-HB level and lessens motor functional impairments. Together, our findings indicate that beta-HB is a critical substrate for EE-mediated stroke recovery and supplementation with beta-HB monoester drinks may serve as a novel strategy to translate EE from bench to bedside."

Numerous studies have revealed BHB's multifaceted roles, including anti-senescence, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system, play a pivotal role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. While BHB is known to alter neuronal metabolism and function, its effects on astrocytes remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted transcriptome sequencing analysis to identify differentially expressed genes induced by BHB in astrocytes and found that the gene Solute carrier family 1 member 3 (Slc1a3), encoding the glutamate transporter EAAT1, was significantly upregulated by BHB treatment. Cellular and animal-based experiments confirmed an increase in EAAT1 protein expression in primary astrocytes and the hippocampus of mice treated with BHB. This upregulation may be due to the activation of the Ca(2+)/CAMKII pathway by BHB. Furthermore, BHB improved astrocytes' glutamate uptake and partially restored neuronal viability impaired by glutamate-induced excitotoxicity when astrocytes were functionalized. Our results suggest that BHB may alleviate neuronal damage caused by excessive glutamate by enhancing the glutamate absorption and uptake capacity of astrocytes. This study proposes a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of BHB and reinforces its beneficial impact on the central nervous system (CNS)."

To determine the reason for this difference, we investigated the pathways of lipogenesis from [3-14C] AcAc, [3-14C] beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta OHB), [U-14C] glucose or [2-14C] pyruvate in minced lung tissue of 3- to 4-day-old rats. The addition of (-)hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, inhibited fatty acid synthesis from glucose, pyruvate, and beta OHB by 88%, 70% and 60%, respectively, but had no effect on that from AcAc. Benzene 1,2,3-tricarboxylate, an inhibitor of tricarboxylate translocase, inhibited fatty acid synthesis from all substrates by at least 50%. Incubation with aminooxyacetate, an inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferase, had no effect on lipid synthesis from glucose, pyruvate or AcAc, but increased lipid synthesis from beta OHB. Results indicate that for lipid synthesis in the neonatal lung, acetyl CoA from AcAc is derived predominantly from a cytoplasmic pathway involving AcAcCoA synthetase and AcAcCoA thiolase, whereas citrate is the major route of acetyl group transfer from glucose. Lipogenesis from beta OHB involves both the cytoplasmic and citrate pathways."

However, the mechanism underlining the physiological effects of ketone accumulation in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is still in its infancy. Here, we discovered that mitochondrial acetyl-CoA accumulation was diverted into the ketogenesis pathway in ethanol-fed mice and ethanol-exposed hepatocytes. Unexpectedly, global protein lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) was induced in response to increased ketogenesis-derived beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels both in hepatocytes and in livers of mice. Focusing on the solute carrier family (SLCs), we found that SLC25A5 presented obvious Kbhb at lysine residues 147 and 166. Kbhb modifications at these two lysine residues stabilized SLC25A5 expression by blocking ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Subsequent mutation analysis revealed that Kbhb of SLC25A5 at K147 and K166 had site-specific regulatory roles by increasing peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) expression, which further promoting lipogenesis. Additionally, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 (HMGCS2), a rate-limiting enzyme for BHB production, was profoundly induced by ethanol exposure, and knockout of Hmgcs2 with CRISPR/Cas9 attenuated SLC25A5 Kbhb.

Evans blue (EB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as determinants of BBB permeability.

The gene expression levels for occludin, glucose transporter (Glut)-1, aquaporin4 (AQP4) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were performed, and Glut-1 and NF-kappaB activities were analyzed. BHB treatment decreased GSH and MDA levels in intact animals and in those exposed to TBI (P<0.05). Glut-1 protein levels decreased in sham, BHB and TBI plus BHB groups (P<0.05). NF-kappaB protein levels increased in animals treated with BHB and/or exposed to TBI (P<0.05). The expression levels of occludin and AQP4 did not significantly change among experimental groups. Glut-1 expression levels increased in BHB treated and untreated animals exposed to TBI (P<0.05). While NF-kappaB expression levels increased in animals in TBI (P<0.01), a decrease was noticed in these animals upon BHB treatment (P<0.01). In animals exposed to TBI, EB extravasation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex regardless of BHB treatment. Ultrastructurally, BHB attenuated but did not prevent the presence of HRP in brain capillary endothelial cells of animals with TBI, moreover, the drug also led to the observation of the tracer when used in intact rats (P<0.01). Altogether, these results showed that BHB not only failed to provide overall protective effects on BBB in TBI but also led to BBB disruption in healthy animals.;We carried out liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of metabolites in mice. Those metabolome data showed that hepatic glucose content is reduced, but that brain glucose content is unaffected, during fasting, consistent with the priority given to brain glucose consumption during fasting. The molecular mechanisms for this preferential glucose supply to the brain are not fully understood. We also showed that the fasting-induced production of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) enhances expression of the glucose transporter gene Slc2a1 (Glut1) via histone modification. Upon beta-OHB treatment, Slc2a1 expression was up-regulated, with a concomitant increase in H3K9 acetylation at the critical cis-regulatory region of the Slc2a1 gene in brain microvascular endothelial cells and NB2a neuronal cells, shown by quantitative PCR analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of the Hdac2 gene increased Slc2a1 expression, suggesting that it is one of the responsible histone deacetylases (HDACs). These results confirm that beta-OHB is a HDAC inhibitor and show that beta-OHB plays an important role in fasting-induced epigenetic activation of a glucose transporter gene in the brain."

Unexpectedly, insulin increased cardiac hydraulic work but decreased net glycolytic flux and O2 consumption, improving net cardiac efficiency by 28%. These improvements in physiologic performance and metabolic efficiency resulted from reduction of the mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] and oxidation of mitochondrial [coenzyme Q]/[coenzyme QH2], increasing the energy of the proton gradient between cytosolic and mitochondrial phases and leading to a doubling of the cytosolic free [sigmaATP]/[sigmaADP][sigmaPi]. The acute metabolic effects of insulin were qualitatively duplicated by addition of a ratio of 4 mM D-beta-hydroxybutyrate and 1 mM acetoacetate, and the increase in the efficiency was the same as with addition of insulin. Addition of both insulin and ketones to the glucose perfusate increased the efficiency of cardiac hydraulic work by 35%. The ability of a physiologic ratio of ketone bodies to correct most of the metabolic defects of acute insulin deficiency suggests therapeutic roles for these natural substrates during periods of impaired cardiac performance and in insulin-resistant states.;OBJECTIVE: Ketogenic diets (KD) have been shown to alleviate insulin resistance (IR) by exerting anti-lipogenic and insulin sensitizing effects in the liver through a variety of pathways. The present study sought to investigate whether a ketogenic diet also improves insulin sensitization in skeletal muscle cells through alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress. METHODS: High-fat diet-induced IR mice were allowed to a 2-week ketogenic diet. Insulin resistance and glucose tolerance were evaluated through GTT, ITT, and HOMA-IR. The C2C12 myoblasts exposed to palmitic acid were used to evaluate the insulin sensitization effects of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (beta-OHB). Molecular mechanisms concerning ER stress signaling activation and glucose uptake were assessed. RESULTS: The AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited, ER stress signaling associated with IRE1, PERK, and BIP was activated, and the number of Glut4 proteins translocated to membrane decreased in the muscle of HFD mice. However, all these changes were reversed after 2 weeks of feeding on a ketogenic diet. Consistently in C2C12 myoblasts, the AKT/GSK3beta pathway was inhibited by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. The endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins, IRE1, and BIP were increased, and the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane decreased. However, beta-OHB treatment alleviated ER stress and improved the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that KD ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, which was partially mediated by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress. The insulin sensitization effect of beta-OHB is associated with up regulation of AKT/GSK3beta pathway and the increase in the number of Glut4 proteins on the cell membrane.;Ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) are oxidized in skeletal muscle mainly during fasting as an alternative source of energy to glucose. Previous studies suggest that there is a negative relationship between increased muscle ketolysis and muscle glucose metabolism in mice with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we investigated the connection between increased ketone body exposure and muscle glucose metabolism by measuring the effect of a 3-h exposure to ketone bodies on glucose uptake in differentiated L6 myotubes. We showed that exposure to acetoacetate at a typical concentration (0.2 mM) resulted in increased basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes, which was dependent on increased membrane glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was also increased with a concentration of acetoacetate reflective of diabetic ketoacidosis or a ketogenic diet (1 mM). We found that beta-hydroxybutyrate had a variable effect on basal glucose uptake: a racemic mixture of the two beta-hydroxybutyrate enantiomers (d and l) appeared to decrease basal glucose uptake, while 3 mM d-beta-hydroxybutyrate alone increased basal glucose uptake. However, the effects of the ketone bodies individually were not observed when acetoacetate was present in combination with beta-hydroxybutyrate. These results provide insight that will help elucidate the effect of ketone bodies in the context of specific metabolic diseases and nutritional states (e.g., type 2 diabetes and ketogenic diets).NEW & NOTEWORTHY A limited number of studies investigate the effect of ketone bodies at concentrations reflective of both typical fasting and ketoacidosis. We tested a mix of physiologically relevant concentrations of ketone bodies, which allowed us to highlight the differential effects of d- and l-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate on skeletal muscle cell glucose uptake. Our findings will assist in better understanding the mechanisms that contribute to muscle insulin resistance and provide guidance on recommendations regarding ketogenic diets."

In this study, we injected different doses of BHB into the lateral ventricle in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rats and neuronal cells were treated with different doses of BHB followed by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that a moderate dose of BHB enhanced mitochondrial complex I respiratory chain complex I activity, reduced oxidative stress, inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis, improved neurological scores, and reduced infarct volume after ischemia. We further showed that the effects of BHB were achieved by upregulating the dedicated BHB transporter SMCT1 and activating the Erk/CREB/eNOS pathway. These results provide us with a foundation for a novel understanding of the neuroprotective effects of BHB in stroke."

Growing evidence suggests the critical role of network excitability during the repair phase for stroke recovery. Here, we show that beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), an essential ketone body (KB) component, is positively correlated with improved outcomes in patients with stroke and promotes functional recovery in rodents with stroke during the repair phase. These beneficial effects of beta-HB depend on HDAC2/HDAC3-GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) signaling-mediated enhancement of excitability and phasic GABA inhibition in the peri-infarct cortex and structural and functional plasticity in the ipsilateral cortex, the contralateral cortex, and the corticospinal tract. Together with available clinical approaches to elevate KB levels, our results offer a clinically translatable means to promote stroke recovery. Furthermore, GAT-1 can serve as a pharmacological target for developing drugs to promote functional recovery after stroke."

The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

The major form of ketone body is beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), which is metabolized by the proximal tubule. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and tubulopathy are important in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, the role of TGF-beta and the downstream Smad3 in beta-HB-induced effects in the human proximal tubule (HK-2 cell) was studied. METHODS: Effects of beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) on HK-2 cells were determined for: proliferation, cell cycle distribution, collagen production, tubular transdifferentiation [expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein], TGF-beta, Smad2/3, p21WAF1, and p27kip1. RESULTS: Beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) dose dependently decreased proliferation, arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours (without affecting p21WAF1/p27kip1 mRNA and transcription). beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein half-lives. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours and TGF-beta1 mRNA/bioactivity at 48 hours. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased nuclear Smad2/3 protein expression and increased collagen production (without affecting tubular transdifferentiation), which were reversed by Smad7, dominant-negative Smad3, and N-acetylcysteine. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours, and reversed TGF-beta1 bioactivity at 48 hours. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours. Finally, N-acetylcysteine, TGF-beta antibody, Smad7, and dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB (1 mmol/L)-induced growth inhibition at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Beta-HB activated Smad 2/3 by oxidative stress. TGF-beta and Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced cell cycle-dependent growth inhibition while Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced collagen production and p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression in HK-2 cells. Moreover, beta-HB increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression by increasing p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein stability.;BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Adipose tissue contains progenitor cells that contribute to beneficial tissue expansion when needed by de novo adipocyte formation (classical white or beige fat cells with thermogenic potential). However, in chronic obesity, they can exhibit an activated pro-fibrotic, extracellular matrix (ECM)-depositing phenotype that highly aggravates obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. METHODS: Given that progenitors' fibrotic activation and fat cell browning appear to be antagonistic cell fates, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of pro-browning agents in an obesogenic condition. RESULTS: In obese mice fed a high fat diet, thermoneutral housing, which induces brown fat cell dormancy, increases the expression of ECM gene programs compared to conventionally raised animals, indicating aggravation of obesity-related tissue fibrosis at thermoneutrality. In a model of primary cultured murine adipose progenitors, we found that exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate selectively reduced Tgfbeta-dependent profibrotic responses of ECM genes like Ctgf, Loxl2 and Fn1. This effect is observed in both subcutaneous and visceral-derived adipose progenitors, as well as in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In 30 patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery, those with higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels have lower subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrotic scores. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate limits Tgfbeta-dependent collagen accumulation and reduces Smad2-3 protein expression and phosphorylation in visceral progenitors. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate induces the expression of the ZFP36 gene, encoding a post-transcriptional regulator that promotes the degradation of mRNA by binding to AU-rich sites within 3'UTRs. Importantly, complete ZFP36 deficiency in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line from null mice, or siRNA knock-down in primary progenitors, indicate that ZFP36 is required for beta-hydroxybutyrate anti-fibrotic effects. CONCLUSION: These data unravel the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate to limit adipose tissue matrix deposition, a finding that might exploited in an obesogenic context."

Rotenone, a mitochondrial stressor induces caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation leading proteolytic cleavage of substrate nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP cleavage is directly related to apoptotic cell death. In this study, we have monitored the aggregation of green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged synphilin-1, as a rotenone-induced Parkinsonia-onset biomarker. We report that the innate ketone body, Na-D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (NabetaHB) reduces markedly the incidence of synphilin-1 aggregation. Furthermore, our data reveal that the metabolic byproduct also prevents rotenone-induced caspase-activated apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells.

The glymphatic system based on aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels on the endfeet of astrocytes is recently discovered as the excretion pathway for metabolic waste products of CNS. In the CNS, alpha-syntrophin (SNTA1) directly or indirectly anchors AQP4 in astrocyte membranes facing blood vessels. Studies have indicated that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) can raise the expression of SNTA1 and thus restoring AQP4 polarity in mice models with Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective mechanism of BHB in rats with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). PDN rats were modeled under a high-fat and high-glucose diet with a low dose of streptozotocin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to observe the clearance of contrast to indicate the functional variability of the spinal glymphatic system. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by paw withdrawal threshold. The expressions of SNTA1 and AQP4 were tested, and the polarity reversal of AQP4 protein was measured. As demonstrated, PDN rats were manifested with deceased contrast clearance of the spinal glymphatic system, enhanced mechanical allodynia, lower expression of SNTA1, higher expression of AQP4, and reversed polarity of AQP4 protein. An opposite change in the above characteristics was observed in rats being treated with BHB. This is the first study that demonstrated the neuroprotective mechanism of BHB to attenuate PDN via restoration of the AQP4 polarity in the spinal glymphatic system and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for PDN.;BACKGROUND: Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. METHODS: The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. RESULTS: Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage."

Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) transport damaged mitochondrial components to lysosomes or the extracellular space. While many metabolites are known to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, it is largely unclear whether they are involved in MDV generation. Here, we discovered that the major component of ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), improved mitochondrial functions by facilitating the biogenesis of MDVs. Mechanistically, BHB drove specific lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), a key regulator of MDV biogenesis. Kbhb increased SNX9 interaction with inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)/matrix proteins and promoted the formation of IMM/matrix MDVs. SNX9 Kbhb was not only critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells but also protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury. Altogether, our research uncovers the fact that metabolites influence the formation of MDVs by directly engaging in post-translational modifications of key protein machineries and establishes a framework for understanding how metabolites regulate mitochondrial functions.;In this issue of Molecular Cell, Tang et al.(1) demonstrate that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) promotes the biogenesis of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) via lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) on SNX9, revealing a way to fine-tune the mitochondrial quality control pathway with metabolites."

In the present study we investigated the role of AcAc and BHB at concentrations found in diabetic patients during ketoacidotic crises and in individuals affected by succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase deficiencies, disorders clinically characterized by neurological symptoms, on a large number of oxidative stress parameters in fresh cerebral cortex of developing rats. Lipid peroxidation (chemiluminescence and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels), protein oxidative damage (carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl oxidation), 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate oxidation and the non-enzymatic (total antioxidant reactivity and glutathione levels) and enzymatic (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) antioxidant defenses were not changed by doses of BHB and AcAc as high as 25 mM in cortical supernatants under basal conditions. Furthermore, BHB did not affect the increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances levels provoked by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and 3-methylglutaconic acids and by a hydroxyl-induced generation system. Finally, BHB and AcAc were not able to oxidize sulfhydryl groups from a commercial GSH solution. Therefore, under basal conditions or under situations with high production of free radicals, AcAc and BHB were not able to reduce or increase the oxidative stress parameters in the brain. Taken together, our present results do not support the hypothesis that BHB and AcAc act as potent direct or indirect pro-oxidants or antioxidants in the CNS.;BACKGROUND: To compare the protective effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid (VPA) on human lens epithelial cells(HLECs) following ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure. METHODS: HLECs were divided into subgroups: four HDACi groups, a control group, a UVB-treated group and a DMSO group (cells treated with DMSO and UVB irradiation). In the HDACi groups, HLECs were cultured with different concentrations of HDACis 12 h prior to UVB irradiation. The protective effects of the HDACis were evaluated by assessing apoptosis rates, cell activity and expression levels of genes associated with apotosis (caspase-3, Bcl-2, BAX, SOD1, FOXO3A and MT2). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were detected in order to evaluate oxidative stress. RESULTS: The results showed that SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) and TSA (0.2 mumol/L) had mild protective effects on cell viability. betaOHB (4 mmol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L) demonstrated protective effects on BCL-2 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) showed protective effects on SOD1 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L) and SAHA (1 mumol/L) suppressed BAX and caspase-3 expression. TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L) and SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) suppressed the expression of FOXO3A and MT2. SOD levels were increased after treatment with betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (8 mumol/L) and TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L). T-AOC levels were increased in UVB-treated HLECs after treatment with SAHA (2 mumol/L). MDA levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with TSA (0.2 mol/L, 0.8 mol/L). ROS levels decreased in UVB-treated HLECs following treatment with betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L) and TSA (0.2 mol/L). Western blotting results demonstrated that SOD1 levels significantly increased in the betaOHB (4 mmol/L), SAHA (1 mumol/L, 2 mumol/L), TSA (0.1 mol/L, 0.2 mol/L) and VPA (5 mmol/L) groups. Only SAHA (1 mumol/L) had an anti-apoptotic effect on UVB-treated HLECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that low concentrations of HDACis (1 mumol/L of SAHA) mildly inhibit oxidative stress, thus protecting HLECs from oxidation. These results may suggest that there is a possibility to explore the clinical applications of HDACis for treatment and prevention of cataracts."

Growing evidence indicates that ketone bodies have beneficial effects in treating stroke, but their underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study showed ketone bodies reduced reactive oxygen species by using NADH as an electron donor, thus increasing the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. In this study, we investigated whether mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) could mediate the neuroprotective effects of ketone bodies after ischemic stroke. We injected mice with either normal saline or ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) at 30 minutes after ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We found that ketone treatment enhanced mitochondria function, reduced oxidative stress, and therefore reduced infarct volume. This led to improved neurologic function after ischemia, including the neurologic score and the performance in Rotarod and open field tests. We further showed that ketones' effects were achieved by upregulating NAD(+)-dependent SIRT3 and its downstream substrates forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the penumbra region since knocking down SIRT3 in vitro diminished ketones' beneficial effects. These results provide us a foundation to develop novel therapeutics targeting this SIRT3-FoxO3a-SOD2 pathway.;Recent studies have shown that the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) acts not only as a carrier of energy but also as a signaling molecule that has a role in diverse cellular functions. Circulating levels of ketone bodies have been previously reported to be increased in patients with congestive heart failure (HF). In this study, we investigated regulatory mechanism and pathophysiological role of betaOHB in HF. First, we revealed that betaOHB level was elevated in failing hearts, but not in blood, using pressure-overloaded mice. We also measured cellular betaOHB levels in both cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes stimulated with or without H2O2 and revealed that increased myocardial betaOHB was derived from cardiomyocytes but not non-cardiomyocytes under pathological states. Next, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms of myocardial betaOHB elevation and its implication under pathological states. The gene and protein expression levels of CoA transferase (SCOT), a key enzyme involved in ketone body oxidation, was decreased in failing hearts. In cardiomyocytes, H2O2 stimulation caused betaOHB accumulation concomitantly with SCOT downregulation, implying that the accumulation of myocardial betaOHB occurs because of the decline in its utilization. Finally, we checked the effects of betaOHB on cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress. We found that betaOHB induced FOXO3a, an oxidative stress resistance gene, and its target enzyme, SOD2 and catalase. Consequently, betaOHB attenuated reactive oxygen species production and alleviated apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. It has been reported that hyperadrenergic state in HF boost lipolysis and result in elevation of circulating free fatty acids, which can lead hepatic ketogenesis for energy metabolism alteration. The present findings suggest that the accumulation of betaOHB also occurs as a compensatory response against oxidative stress in failing hearts.;beta-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body that is used as an energy source in organs such as the brain, muscle, and heart when blood glucose is low, is produced by fatty acid oxidation in the liver under the fasting state. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of misfolded protein in the ER. ER stress is known to induce the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which mediates activation of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta, whose maturation is caspase-1-dependent. We investigated whether beta-hydroxybutyrate modulates ER stress, inflammasome formation, and insulin signaling. Sprague Dawley rats (6 and 24 months of age) that were starved for 3 d and rats treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate (200 mg.kg-1.d-1 i.p., for 5 d) were used for in vivo investigations, whereas human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used for in vitro studies. Overexpression of AMPK in cultured cells was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism. The starvation resulted in increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels with decreased ER stress (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6alpha) and inflammasome (ASC, caspase-1, and NLRP3) formation compared with non-fasted 24-month-old rats. In addition, beta-hydroxybutyrate suppressed the increase of ER stress- and inflammasome-related marker proteins. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase via the AMP-activated protein kinase-forkhead box protein O3alpha transcription factor pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The significance of the current study was the discovery of the potential therapeutic role of beta-hydroxybutyrate in suppressing ER-stress-induced inflammasome formation.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to severe motor and sensory dysfunction and significantly reduces the quality of life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of administration of exogenous D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) on functional recovery and neuropathic pain in spinal cord-injured mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given a moderate-severe thoracic spinal contusion injury at the T(9-10) level and treated with exogenous DBHB. KEY RESULTS: Treatment of SCI mice with DBHB markedly improved locomotor function and relieved SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation. DBHB treatment partly prevented the SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and suppressed microglial and glial activation. DBHB treatment enhanced histone acetylation and up-regulated expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, catalase and SOD2 in injured region of SCI mice. DBHB treatment suppressed SCI-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reduced protein expression of IL-1beta and IL-18. In addition, DBHB treatment improved mitochondrial function and abated oxidative stress following SCI. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: DBHB promoted functional recovery and relieved pain hypersensitivity in mice with SCI, possibly through inhibition of histone deacetylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preservation of mitochondrial function. DBHB could thus be envisaged as a potential use of interventions for SCI but remains to be tested in humans.;The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB), is reported to be neuroprotective after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate effects of betaOHB on suppression of oxidative stress and inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) in in vivo and in vitro models. Rats were fed with ketogenic diet (KD) or standard diet (SD) for 3 weeks. A C5 hemi-contusion injury was applied to these animals on the 14th day of experiment, and spinal cord samples were harvested on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after SCI, respectively. The blood ketone levels were significantly higher in the KD groups. KD reduced oxidative stress markers and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products, downregulated the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)2 and NOX4, and upregulated the expression of forkhead box group O (FOXO)3a, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and catalase after SCI. The in vitro study, performed on PC12 cells, indicated that betaOHB inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production, decreased NOX2 and NOX4 protein levels, and upregulated FOXO3a, MnSOD, and catalase levels in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the in vivo results. The ketone metabolite betaOHB inhibited HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 activity, but not HDAC8 in SCI rats and PC12 cells. Depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production and protein carbonylation and elevated FOXO3a protein levels, meanwhile reducing NOX2 and NOX4 protein expression in PC12 cells. Our results indicate that the ketone metabolite betaOHB attenuates oxidative stress in SCI by inhibition of class I HDACs, and selected suppression of HDAC1 or HDAC2 regulates FOXO3a, NOX2, and NOX4 expression. Therefore, the ketone metabolite betaOHB may be a novel promising therapeutic agent for SCI.;The mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiac events in diabetic patients remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on the acute survival rate after myocardial infarction (MI) in an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and the possible involvement of modification of cardiac metabolomes and antioxidative proteins. MI was induced in DM Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) control rats. Treatment with empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day, 14 days) before MI reduced blood glucose and increased blood and myocardial beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) levels in OLETF. Survival rate at 48 hours after MI was significantly lower in OLETF rats than in LETO rats (40% vs. 84%), and empagliflozin significantly improved the survival rate in OLETF rats to 70%, although the sizes of MI were comparable. Patterns of metabolomes and gene expression in the noninfarcted myocardium of OLETF rats were consistent with increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glucose oxidation. The patterns were modified by empagliflozin, suggesting both increased glucose oxidation and ketone utilization in OLETF rats. Empagliflozin prevented reduction of ATP level in the noninfarcted myocardium after MI and significantly increased myocardial levels of Sirt3 and superoxide dismutase 2 in OLETF rats. Administration of betaOHB partially mimicked the effects of empagliflozin in OLETF rats. The results suggest that empagliflozin prevents DM-induced increase in post-MI mortality, possibly by protective modification of cardiac energy metabolism and antioxidant proteins."

Aging is the most significant risk factor for the progression of MS. Dietary modulation (such as ketogenic diet) and caloric restriction, can increase ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

Male adult mice were exposed to 30 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously 5 min before reperfusion for continuous delivery of the exogenous BHB (1.6 mmol/kg/24 h). Treatment with BHB reduced infarct size and levels of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum, attenuated apoptosis in myocardium, and preserved cardiac function of I/R mice. Importantly, treatment of I/R mice with BHB promoted autophagic flux, evidenced by reduced the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and protein expression of p62 and enhanced protein expression of lysosome associated membrane protein-2 (Lamp2) in myocardium. Treatment of I/R mice with BHB reduced mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species, enhanced adenosine triphosphate production, attenuated mitochondrial swelling, and partly restored mitochondrial membrane potential in myocardium. Furthermore, treatment of I/R mice with BHB abated oxidative stress and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress in myocardium. Our results indicated that treatment with exogenous BHB protected heart from I/R injury in mice.;Glucose supply from blood is mandatory for brain functioning and its interruption during acute hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia leads to brain injury. Alternative substrates to glucose such as the ketone bodies (KB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can be used as energy fuels in the brain during hypoglycemia and prevent neuronal death, but the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. During glucose deprivation adaptive cell responses can be activated such as autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent degradation process, to support cell survival. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can lead to cell dysfunction. We have previously shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation in cortical neurons and that D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) reestablishes the autophagic flux increasing viability. Here, we aimed to investigate autophagy dynamics in the brain of rats subjected to severe hypoglycemia (SH) without glucose infusion (GI), severe hypoglycemia followed by GI (SH + GI), and a brief period of hypoglycemic coma followed by GI (Coma). The effect of D-BHB administration after the coma was also tested (Coma + BHB). The transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II and the abundance of autophagy proteins, Beclin 1 (BECN1), ATG7, and ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, were analyzed as an index of autophagosome formation, and the levels of sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) were determined as a hallmark of autophagic degradation. Data suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats after SH, likely due to impaired autophagic degradation. In the cortex, autophagosome accumulation persisted at 6 h after GI in animals exposed to SH but recovered basal levels at 24 h, while in the hippocampus no significant effect was observed. In animals subjected to coma, autophagosome accumulation was observed at 24 h after GI in both regions. D-BHB treatment reduced LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 content and reduced ULK1 phosphorylation by AMPK, suggesting it stimulates the autophagic flux and decreases AMPK activity reducing autophagy initiation. D-BHB also reduced the number of degenerating cells. Together, data suggest different autophagy dynamics after GI in rats subjected to SH or the hypoglycemic coma and support that D-BHB treatment can modulate autophagy dynamics favoring the autophagic flux.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disease characterized by the build-up of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes synapse dysfunction, cell death, and neuro-inflammation. A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis. More research is needed to fully comprehend the processes behind their beneficial effects and to discover their practical applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.;One of the therapeutic approaches to age-related diseases is modulation of body cell metabolism through certain diets or their pharmacological mimetics. The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals.;D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, BHB, has been previously proposed as an anti-senescent agent in vitro and in vivo in several tissues including vascular smooth muscle. Moreover, BHB derivatives as ketone esters alleviate heart failure. Here, we provide evidence of the potential therapeutic effect of BHB on Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare condition characterized by premature aging and heart failure, caused by the presence of progerin, the aberrant protein derived from LMNA/C gene c.1824C > T mutation. We have assessed several hallmarks of HGPS-senescent phenotype in vitro, such as progerin levels, nuclear morphometric aberrations, nucleolar expansion, cellular senescent morphology, SA-betaGal-positive cells, H3K9me3 heterochromatin, gammaH2AX foci, Lamin B1, p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p16(CDKN2A) abundance, and autophagy. Strikingly, BHB improved nuclear and nucleolar morphometrics, diminished the senescence-phenotype, and unstuck autophagy in HGPS as observed by an enhanced degradation of the cargo protein receptor SQSTM1/p62, suggesting the stimulation of the autophagic flux. Additionally, we observed a decrease in progerin abundance, the cause of senescence in HGPS. Furthermore, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, and SBI-0206965, an inhibitor of ULK1/2 and AMPK, which prevent autophagy activation, reversed BHB-induced progerin decline as well as its anti-senescent effect in an AMPK-mTORC1 dependent manner. Altogether, these results suggest that the anti-senescence effect of BHB involves progerin clearance by autophagy activation supporting the potential of BHB for HGPS therapeutics and further preclinical trials."

Neither betaHB nor AcAc are well utilized for synthesis of sterols or fatty acids in human or rat liver. To study the effects of ketones on cholesterol homeostasis a novel betaHB ester (KE) ((R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate) was synthesized and given orally to rats and humans as a partial dietary carbohydrate replacement. Rats maintained on a diet containing 30-energy % as KE with a concomitant reduction in carbohydrate had lower plasma cholesterol and mevalonate (-40 and -27 %, respectively) and in the liver had lower levels of the mevalonate precursors acetoacetyl-CoA and HMG-CoA (-33 and -54 %) compared to controls. Whole liver and membrane LDL-R as well as SREBP-2 protein levels were higher (+24, +67, and +91 %, respectively). When formulated into a beverage for human consumption subjects consuming a KE drink (30-energy %) had elevated plasma betaHB which correlated with decreased mevalonate, a liver cholesterol synthesis biomarker. Partial replacement of dietary carbohydrate with KE induced ketosis and altered cholesterol homeostasis in rats. In healthy individuals an elevated plasma betaHB correlated with lower plasma mevalonate."

We found (1) that the addition of 10 mM DL-BOH to the perfusate augmented somatostatin secretion from the normal dog pancreas. The responses obtained were, however, modified by the prevailing glucose level with higher responses appearing at high (11 mM) rather than at zero glucose. The effect of BOH could not be attributed to changes in osmolarity, Na+, or H+ concentrations. (2) BOH at doses well within the physiologic and pathophysiologic range stimulated the secretion of somatostatin from the normal pancreas in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentration was close to 1 mM corresponding to 0.5 mM of the biologically active D form. (3) In the STZ-diabetic dogs, BOH (1-20 mM) elicits a dose-related enhancement of the pancreatic somatostatin secretion. In the two groups, identical D-cell responses were obtained at 3, 10, and 20 mM BOH. The results demonstrate that physiologic levels of BOH stimulates the release of somatostatin from pancreas of normal and STZ-diabetic dogs, thereby providing support for a physiologic influence of BOH over the secretory function of the pancreatic D-cell. The possible existence of a BOH-somatostatin feed-back mechanism operating in the diabetic organism is discussed."

Recent studies found that beta-OHB inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, but its underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), a post-translational modification mediated by beta-OHB, plays a key role in regulating the expression and activity of modified proteins. However, whether macrophages undergo protein Kbhb and whether Kbhb modification regulates macrophage polarization remains largely unknown. In this study, treatment with beta-OHB and ketone ester significantly decreased the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced enhancement of the M1 phenotype of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), RAW264.7 cells, and peritoneal macrophages (PMs) in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, beta-OHB treatment induced global protein Kbhb, which is associated with the regulation of macrophage M1 polarization. Proteome-wide Kbhb analysis in beta-OHB-treated BMDMs revealed 3469 Kbhb modification sites within 1549 proteins, among which interleukin-12-responding proteins were significantly upregulated. Our results indicated that beta-OHB regulated M1 macrophage polarization by inducing Kbhb modification of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) K679 site, which inhibited its LPS-induced phosphorylation and transcription. Altogether, our study demonstrated the presence of a widespread Kbhb landscape in the beta-OHB-treated macrophages and provided novel insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of beta-OHB."

Growing evidence implies beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the ketone bodies generated by ketogenesis, plays a neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to verify the anti-inflammatory effect of BHB on PD and further explore potential molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We performed the experiments on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice model in vivo and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))-simulated BV2 cell model in vitro, with or without BHB pretreatment. Motor function was assessed by pole test, forced swimming test, traction test and open field test. Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in MPTP-induced PD model mice. The expression of the STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway was measured by western blots. Proinflammatory cytokines was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: BHB treatment reversed motor deficits, loss of dopaminergic neurons and glial cell activation in PD mice induced by MPTP. Moreover, BHB inhibited microglia pyroptosis by negatively regulating STAT3/NLRP3/GSDMD signal pathway, resulting in downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IL-18) in vivo and vitro. CONCLUSION: These data suggested BHB supplement inhibited pyroptosis by down-regulating STAT3-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation for PD models in vivo and in vitro. Our findings provided novel insights and available interventions for the prevention and treatment of PD, and highlighted pyroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for PD.;The liver regenerative capacity is crucial for patients with end-stage liver disease following partial hepatectomy (PHx). The specific bacteria and mechanisms regulating liver regeneration post-PHx remain unclear. This study demonstrated dynamic changes in the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) post-PHx, correlating with hepatocyte proliferation. Treatment with live P. distasonis significantly promoted hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration after PHx. Targeted metabolomics revealed a significant positive correlation between P. distasonis and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), as well as hyodeoxycholic acid and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in the gut after PHx. Notably, treatment with BHB, but not hyodeoxycholic acid or 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, significantly promoted hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in mice after PHx. Moreover, STAT3 inhibitor Stattic attenuated the promotive effects of BHB on cell proliferation and liver regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, P. distasonis upregulated the expression of fatty acid oxidation-related proteins, and increased BHB levels in the liver, and then BHB activated the STAT3 signaling pathway to promote liver regeneration. This study, for the first time, identifies the involvement of P. distasonis and its associated metabolite BHB in promoting liver regeneration after PHx, providing new insights for considering P. distasonis and BHB as potential strategies for promoting hepatic regeneration."

However, the role of BHB in intestinal inflammation has not yet been investigated. METHODS: Colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy controls were collected for evaluation of BHB level. Besides, the therapeutic effect of exogenous BHB in a murine model of acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis were assessed by body weight change, colon length, disease activity index, and histopathological sections. The regulatory effectors of BHB were analyzed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, and microbe analysis in vivo. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of BHB was further verified in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). RESULTS: In this study, significantly reduced BHB levels were found in the colonic mucosa from IBD patients and correlated with IBD activity index. In addition, we demonstrated that the administration of exogenous BHB alleviated the severity of acute experimental colitis, which was characterized by less weight loss, disease activity index, colon shortening, and histology scores, as well as decreased crypt loss and epithelium damage. Furthermore, BHB resulted in significantly increased colonic expression of M2 macrophage-associated genes, including IL-4Ra, IL-10, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and chitinase-like protein 3, following DSS exposure, suggesting an increased M2 macrophage skewing in vivo. Moreover, an in vitro experiment revealed that the addition of BHB directly promoted STAT6 phosphorylation and M2 macrophage-specific gene expression in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Besides, we found that BHB obviously increased M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair through promoting intestinal epithelial proliferation. However, the enhancement effect of BHB on M2 macrophage-induced mucosal repair and anti-inflammation was completely inhibited by the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we show that BHB promotes M2 macrophage polarization through the STAT6-dependent signaling pathway, which contributes to the resolution of intestinal inflammation and the repair of damaged intestinal tissues. Our finding suggests that exogenous BHB supplement may be a useful therapeutic approach for IBD treatment."

However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart."

Herein, we carried out 4D label-free beta-hydroxybutylation quantitative proteomics using brain samples of 8-month-old and 2-month-old APP/PS1 AD model mice and wild-type (WT) controls. We identified a series of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-associated enzymes including citrate synthase (CS) and succinate-CoA ligase subunit alpha (SUCLG1), whose Kbhb modifications were decreased in APP/PS1 mice at pathological stages. Sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (Na-beta-OHB) treatment markedly increased Kbhb modifications of CS and SUCLG1 and their enzymatic activities, leading to elevated ATP production. We further found that Kbhb modifications at lysine 393 site in CS and at lysine 81 site in SUCLG1 were crucial for their enzymatic activities. Finally, we found that beta-OHB levels were decreased in the brain of APP/PS1 mice at pathological stages. While ketogenic diet not only significantly increased beta-OHB levels, Kbhb modifications and enzymatic activities of CS and SUCLG1, and ATP production, but also dramatically attenuated beta-amyloid plaque pathologies and microgliosis in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our findings indicate the importance of protein Kbhb modification for maintaining normal TCA cycle and ATP production and provide a novel molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet on energy metabolism and AD intervention."

To determine the neuroregenerative potential of D,L-sodium-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D/L-BHB), Sprague Dawley rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to simulated central nervous system injury using a scratch assay. The neuronal cell migration, cell density and degree of regeneration in the damaged areas (gaps) in the absence (control) and presence of BHB (2 mM) were documented with automated live-cell imaging by the CytoSMART system over 24 h, which was followed by immunocytochemistry, labeling synapsin-I and beta3-tubulin. The cell density was significantly higher in the gaps with BHB treatment after 24 h compared to the control. In the control, only 1.5% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h, while in the BHB-treated samples 49.23% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h. In the control, the gap expanded by 63.81% post-injury, while the gap size decreased by 10.83% in response to BHB treatment, compared to the baseline. The cell density increased by 97.27% and the gap size was reduced by 74.64% in response to BHB, compared to the control. The distance travelled and velocity of migrating cells were significantly higher with BHB treatment, while more synapsin-I and beta3-tubulin were found in the BHB-treated samples after 24 h, compared to the control. The results demonstrate that D/L-BHB enhanced neuronal migration and molecular processes associated with neural regeneration and axonogenesis. These results may have clinical therapeutic applications in the future for nervous system injuries, such as for stroke, concussion and TBI patients."
ENSG00000171992,SYNPO,0.20915721,weak,1,34246657,2021,Kidney,The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate mitigates the senescence response of glomerular podocytes to diabetic insults.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes and is clinically featured by progressive albuminuria, consequent to glomerular destruction that involves podocyte senescence. Burgeoning evidence suggests that ketosis, in particular beta-hydroxybutyrate, exerts a beneficial effect on aging and on myriad metabolic or chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. Its effect on DKD is largely unknown. In vitro in podocytes exposed to a diabetic milieu, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment substantially mitigated cellular senescence and injury, as evidenced by reduced formation of gammaH2AX foci, reduced staining for senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity, diminished expression of key mediators of senescence signaling like p16(INK4A) and p21, and preserved expression of synaptopodin. This beneficial action of beta-hydroxybutyrate coincided with a reinforced transcription factor Nrf2 antioxidant response. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a convergent point for myriad signaling pathways regulating Nrf2 activity, seems to contribute. Indeed, trigonelline, a selective inhibitor of Nrf2, or ectopic expression of constitutively active mutant GSK3beta abolished, whereas selective activation of Nrf2 was sufficient for the anti-senescent and podocyte protective effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Moreover, molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that beta-hydroxybutyrate is able to directly target the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3beta and thereby block its kinase activity. In murine models of streptozotocin-elicited DKD, beta-hydroxybutyrate therapy inhibited GSK3beta and reinforced Nrf2 activation in glomerular podocytes, resulting in lessened podocyte senescence and injury and improved diabetic glomerulopathy and albuminuria. Thus, our findings may pave the way for developing a beta-hydroxybutyrate-based novel approach of therapeutic ketosis for treating DKD."

The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

The ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), is metabolized to acetyl-CoA in brain mitochondria and used as an energy fuel alternative to glucose. We have previously reported that D-BHB sustains ATP production and stimulates the autophagic flux under glucose deprivation in neurons, however, the effects of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover under physiological conditions are still unknown. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD(+)-activated protein deacetylases involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy through the activation of transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3a, TFEB and PGC1alpha coactivator. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover in cultured neurons and the mechanisms involved. Results show that D-BHB increased mitochondrial membrane potential and regulated the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. D-BHB enhanced FOXO1, FOXO3a and PGC1alpha nuclear levels in an SIRT2-dependent manner and stimulated autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects increased neuronal resistance to energy stress. D-BHB also stimulated the autophagic-lysosomal pathway through AMPK activation and TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis. Upregulation of SIRT2, FOXOs, PGC1alpha and TFEB was confirmed in the brain of ketogenic diet (KD)-treated mice. Altogether, the results identify SIRT2, for the first time, as a target of D-BHB in neurons, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control."

The major form of ketone body is beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), which is metabolized by the proximal tubule. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and tubulopathy are important in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, the role of TGF-beta and the downstream Smad3 in beta-HB-induced effects in the human proximal tubule (HK-2 cell) was studied. METHODS: Effects of beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) on HK-2 cells were determined for: proliferation, cell cycle distribution, collagen production, tubular transdifferentiation [expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein], TGF-beta, Smad2/3, p21WAF1, and p27kip1. RESULTS: Beta-HB (0.1 to 10 mmol/L) dose dependently decreased proliferation, arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours (without affecting p21WAF1/p27kip1 mRNA and transcription). beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein half-lives. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours and TGF-beta1 mRNA/bioactivity at 48 hours. Beta-HB (1 mmol/L) increased nuclear Smad2/3 protein expression and increased collagen production (without affecting tubular transdifferentiation), which were reversed by Smad7, dominant-negative Smad3, and N-acetylcysteine. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced TGF-beta transcription at 24 hours, and reversed TGF-beta1 bioactivity at 48 hours. Dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB-induced p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression at 48 hours. Finally, N-acetylcysteine, TGF-beta antibody, Smad7, and dominant-negative Smad3 reversed beta-HB (1 mmol/L)-induced growth inhibition at 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Beta-HB activated Smad 2/3 by oxidative stress. TGF-beta and Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced cell cycle-dependent growth inhibition while Smad3 mediate beta-HB-induced collagen production and p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression in HK-2 cells. Moreover, beta-HB increased p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein expression by increasing p21WAF1/p27kip1 protein stability.;Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM beta-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-beta1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. beta-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN.;Hyperketonemia is a common condition in early-lactation dairy cows that has been associated with an increase in the risk of infectious disease. Recent mouse studies have elucidated an anti-inflammatory effect of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether BHB altered inflammatory responses in macrophages challenged with the common mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. A secondary objective was to determine whether the inflammatory response to the S. uberis challenge was dependent on whether BHB was present in the medium during the challenge (i.e., preconditioned vs. continuous treatment). Two cell culture experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 line) were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was then replaced with a standard cell culture medium, and the cells were challenged or not with S. uberis for an additional 6 h. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was used, however, cells were preconditioned with BHB (0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mM) for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the same concentration of BHB, and cells were either challenged or not with S. uberis for 6 h. In both experiments, relative transcript abundance of cell membrane receptors (Tlr2 and Gpr109a), cytokines (Il1b, Il10, Tnf, and Tgfb1), and chemokines (Cxcl2 and Ccl5) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the geometric mean of Hprt and B2m. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model, and orthogonal contrasts were conducted to examine the effect of S. uberis challenge and BHB treatment. Streptococcus uberis activated the macrophages, noted by greater transcript abundance of analyzed genes. Intriguingly, in both experiments, the S. uberis challenge increased expression of Gpr109a, which encodes a receptor that is ligated by BHB. Paradoxically, preconditioning macrophages with BHB increased transcript abundance of the immunosuppressive cytokine Tgfb1 and increased that of the neutrophil chemoattractant Cxcl2. Preconditioning decreased Tlr2 and tended to decrease Il10 transcript abundance. In opposition to the preconditioning experiment, continuous treatment of BHB during the S. uberis challenge linearly increased abundance of Tlr2 and Il10 transcripts. Continuous BHB treatment also increased expression of Il1b. In conclusion, BHB treatment altered macrophage inflammatory responses during an S. uberis challenge, however, the direction of this response was dependent on whether BHB was added to the medium during the S. uberis challenge. Future studies should be conducted using bovine macrophages and in vivo approaches to examine BHB effects during an S. uberis challenge."

Hence, developing agents that antagonize fibrogenic signals is a critical issue facing researchers. The present study investigated the blood-circulation-promoting Chinese herb, safflower, on fibrosis status in NRK-49F cells, a normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast, to evaluate the underlying signal transduction mechanism of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a potent fibrogenic growth factor. Safflower was characterized and extracted using water. Renal fibrosis model was established both in vitro with fibroblast cells treated with beta-hydroxybutyrate and in vivo using rats undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Western blotting was used to examine protein expression in TGF-beta-related signal proteins such as type I and type II TGF-beta receptor, Smads2/3, pSmad2/3, Smads4, and Smads7. ELISA was used to analyze bioactive TGF-beta1 and fibronectin levels in the culture media. Safflower extract (SE) significantly inhibited beta-HB-induced fibrosis in NRK cells concomitantly with dose-dependent inhibition of the type I TGF-beta1 receptor and its down-stream signals (i.e., Smad). Moreover, SE dose-dependently enhanced inhibitory Smad7. Thus, SE can suppress renal cellular fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-beta autocrine loop. Moreover, remarkably lower levels of tissue collagen were noted in the nephron and serum TGF-beta1 of UUO rats receiving oral SE (0.15 g/3 ml/0.25 kg/day) compared with the untreated controls. Hence, SE is a potential inhibitor of renal fibrosis. We suggest that safflower is a novel renal fibrosis antagonist that functions by down-regulating TGF-beta signals."

Adiposity is a noted modifiable metabolic risk factor for stroke, and recent research suggests that it benefits neurological rehabilitation. During the early phase of experimental stroke, the lipidomic results showed that fat depots underwent pronounced lipolysis and released fatty acids (FAs) that feed into consequent hepatic FA oxidation and ketogenesis. Systemic supplementation with the predominant ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is found to exert discernible effects on preserving blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and facilitating neuroinflammation resolution. Meanwhile, blocking FAO-ketogenesis processes by administration of CPT1alpha antagonist or shRNA targeting HMGCS2 exacerbated endothelial damage and aggravated stroke severity, whereas BHB supplementation blunted these injuries. Mechanistically, it is unveiled that BHB infusion is taken up by monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1) specifically expressed in cerebral endothelium and upregulated the expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 by enhancing local beta-hydroxybutyrylation of H3K9 at the promoter of TJP1 gene. Conclusively, an adaptive metabolic mechanism is elucidated by which acute lipolysis stimulates FAO-ketogenesis processes to restore BBB integrity after stroke. Ketogenesis functions as an early metabolic responder to restrain stroke progression, providing novel prospectives for clinical translation."

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in signal transduction in inflammatory conditions. However, alterations in TLR expression following hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation have not been well documented. This study was conducted to measure the impact of different resuscitation strategies on TLR expression and downstream signaling in key organs. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats (n=38) were subjected to a severe volume-controlled hemorrhage protocol. After 75 min of shock, they were resuscitated over 45 min as follows: (1) lactated Ringer's (LR, 81 ml/kg), (2) ketone Ringer's (KR, 81 ml/kg), (3) 7.5% hypertonic saline (HTS, 9.7 ml/kg), (4) 6% hetastarch (HEX, 27 ml/kg), (5) pyruvate Ringer's (PR, 81 ml/kg). Sham hemorrhage (NH) and no resuscitation (NR) groups served as controls. The KR and PR solutions were identical to LR except for equimolar substitution of racemic lactate with beta hydroxybutyrate and sodium pyruvate, respectively. At the end of resuscitation, the expression of TLRs (types 1-10), and cytokines (IL-10, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) were measured in the lung and spleen using RT-PCR. Levels of phosphorylated and total IkB-alpha and NF-kappaB were detected by Western blotting. The systemic and lung protein levels of TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Expression of TLRs in the lung was affected more than in the spleen by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.

Levels of phosphorylated and total IkB-alpha and NF-kappaB were detected by Western blotting. The systemic and lung protein levels of TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Expression of TLRs in the lung was affected more than in the spleen by hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. In the lung, hemorrhage increased TLR-2, -3 and -6 (but not TLR-4) mRNA expression, with an up-regulation of the ratio of phosphor-NF-kappaBp65 and total NF-kappaBp65, NF-kappaBp65 activation, and enhanced systemic and tissue TNF-alpha protein levels. Post-resuscitation, TLR mRNA profile and subsequent downstream proteins in the lung and spleen were affected by the choice of resuscitation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic shock activates TLR signaling in lung, but not the spleen, probably through an up-regulation of TLR gene expression, and activation of NF-kappaB pathway. Resuscitation modulates this response in a fluid- and tissue-specific fashion.;Accumulating evidence suggests that elevated inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that anti-inflammatory drugs might be a new treatment strategy for PTSD. It has been reported that beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the main ketone bodies produced, can have an anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effect. Here, we investigated the potential anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory effects of BHB using a rodent PTSD model, induced by single prolonged stress (SPS). Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were employed in this study. Repeated administration of BHB attenuated SPS-induced anxiety-related behaviors evaluated by the elevated plus maze test. SPS increased the serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. In contrast, BHB administration partially attenuated the increase of serum TNF-alpha. These findings demonstrate that BHB exerts its anxiolytic effects, possibly by inhibiting systemic TNF-alpha. Hence, BHB may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PTSD.;BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a widespread disease resulting from the inflammation of acinar cells in the pancreas. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a water-soluble main ketone body synthesized in the human liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the possible therapeutic effects of BHB in the experimentally-induced AP model in rats. METHODS: In our study, male rats were randomly allotted into 6 groups, as control (0.9% saline i.p.), BHB1 (200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), BHB2 (2 doses of 200 mg/kg BHB i.p.), AP (4 doses of 50 mug/kg cerulein i.p., 4 doses at 1 h intervals), AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In pancreatic tissue sections, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis for the inflammasome complex (caspase-1, ASC, and NLRP3) and inflammation-associated proteins (TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB) and a histopathological examination were performed. The levels of lipase, amylase, interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta in serum were measured. RESULTS: Several pathological degenerations, including edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, acinus necrosis, and bleeding were observed in the AP group, while the histological architecture of the control and the sham BHB1 and BHB2 groups were regular. The AP-induced pathological changes were considerably alleviated in the AP+BHB1 and AP+BHB2 groups. In the AP group, a conspicuous increase in caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB proteins, and in the levels of amylase, lipase, IL-18, and IL-1beta were detected. BHB treatments after AP induction decreased those proteins to the level of control. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that BHB has the potential to cure AP by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome and can be used in the treatment of many diseases which progress through the NLRP3 inflammasome.;OBJECTIVE: Neointimal hyperplasia is the primary mechanism underlying atherosclerosis and restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Ketogenic diet (KD) exerts beneficial effects in various diseases, but whether it could serve as non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of KD on neointimal hyperplasia and the potential mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery balloon-injury model was employed in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce neointimal hyperplasia. Then, animals were subjected to either standard rodent chow or KD. For in-vitro experiment, impacts of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), the main mediator of KD effects, on platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation were determined. Balloon injury induced event intimal hyperplasia and upregulation of protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and these changes were significantly ameliorated by KD. In addition, beta-HB could markedly inhibit PDGF-BB induced VMSC migration and proliferation, as well as inhibiting expressions of PCNA and alpha-SMC. Furthermore, KD inhibited balloon-injury induced oxidative stress in carotid artery, indicated by reduced ROS level, malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. We also found balloon-injury induced inflammation in carotid artery was suppressed by KD, indicated by decreased expressions of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. CONCLUSION: KD attenuates neointimal hyperplasia through suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation to inhibit VSMC proliferation and migration. KD may represent a promising non-drug therapy for neointimal hyperplasia associated diseases.;Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colorectal area that demonstrates a dramatically increasing incidence worldwide. This study provides novel insights into the capacity of the exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketogenic diet (KD) consumption to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in rats. Remarkably, both interventions attenuated disease activity and colon weight-to-length ratio, and improved macro and microstructures of the damaged colon. Importantly, both beta-hydroxybutyrate and KD curbed the DSS-induced aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation as observed in mRNA and protein expression analysis. Additionally, inhibition of the NLRP3/NGSDMD-mediated pyroptosis was detected in response to both regimens. In parallel, these modalities attenuated caspase-1 and its associated consequences of IL-1beta and IL-18 overproduction. They also mitigated apoptosis as indicated by the inactivation of caspase-3. The anti-inflammatory effects of BHB and KD were confirmed by the reported decline in the levels of inflammatory markers including MPO, NFkappaB, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Moreover, these interventions exhibited antioxidative properties by reducing ROS production and improving antioxidative enzymes. Their effectiveness in mitigating UC was also evident in the renovation of normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, as shown by correcting the discrepancies in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN5. Furthermore, their effects on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis were investigated. In terms of autophagy, exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate upregulated BECN-1 and downregulated p62, which may account for its superiority over KD in attenuating colonic damage. In conclusion, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential therapeutic use of beta-hydroxybutyrate or beta-hydroxybutyrate-boosting regimens in UC.;The consequences of stroke include cognitive deficits and sensorimotor disturbances, which are largely related to mitochondrial impairments in the brain. In this work, we have shown that the mimetic of the ketogenic diet beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) can improve neurological brain function in stroke. At 3 weeks after photothrombotic stroke, mice receiving betaHB with drinking water before and after surgery recovered faster in terms of sensorimotor functions assessed by the string test and static rods and cognitive functions assessed by the Morris water maze. At the same time, the betaHB-treated mice had lower expression of some markers of astrocyte activation and inflammation (Gfap, Il-1b, Tnf). We hypothesize that long-term administration of betaHB promotes the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway, which leads to increased expression of antioxidant genes targeting mitochondria and genes involved in signaling pathways necessary for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity. betaHB partially maintained mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity during the first days after photothrombosis. However, in the following three weeks, the number of mtDNA damages increased in all experimental groups, which coincided with a decrease in Ogg1 expression, which plays an important role in mtDNA repair. Thus, we can assume that betaHB is not only an important metabolite that provides additional energy to brain tissue during recovery from stroke under conditions of mitochondrial damage but also an important signaling molecule that supports neuronal plasticity and reduces neuroinflammation.;Brain glucose deprivation is a component of the pathophysiology of ischemia, glucose transporter1 (GLUT1) deficiency, neurological disorders and occurs transiently in diabetes. Microglia, the neuroimmune cells must function effectively to offer immune defence and debris removal in low-energy settings. Brain glucose deprivation may compromise microglial functions further escalating the disease pathology and deteriorating the overall mental health. In the current study, HMC3 human microglia-like cells were cultured in vitro and exposed to glucose deprivation to investigate the effects of glucose deprivation on phenotypic state, redox status, secretion of cytokines and phagocytic capabilities of HMC3 cells. However, HMC3 cells were able to proliferate in the absence of glucose but showed signs of redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, as demonstrated by decreased MTT reduction and Mito Tracker staining of cells, along with a concomitant reduction in NOX2 protein, superoxide, and nitrite levels. Reduced levels of secreted TNF and IL-1beta were the signs of compromised cytokine secretion by glucose-deprived HMC3 microglia-like cells. Moreover, glucose-deprived HMC3 cells also showed reduced phagocytic activity as assessed by fluorescently labelled latex beads-based functional phagocytosis assay. beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation restored the redox status, mitochondrial health, cytokine secretion, and phagocytic activity of glucose-deprived HMC3 microglia-like cells. Overall, impaired brain glucose metabolism may hinder microglia's capacity to release diffusible immune factors and perform phagocytosis. This could escalate the mental health issues in neurological diseases where brain glucose metabolism is compromised. Moreover, nutritional ketosis or exogenous ketone supplementation such as BHB may be utilized as a potential metabolic therapies for these conditions."

However, the effects of fasting on muscle regeneration are largely unknown. Here, we report that fasting slows muscle repair both immediately after the conclusion of fasting as well as after multiple days of refeeding. We show that ketosis, either endogenously produced during fasting or a ketogenic diet or exogenously administered, promotes a deep quiescent state in muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Although deep quiescent MuSCs are less poised to activate, slowing muscle regeneration, they have markedly improved survival when facing sources of cellular stress. Furthermore, we show that ketone bodies, specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate, directly promote MuSC deep quiescence via a nonmetabolic mechanism. We show that beta-hydroxybutyrate functions as an HDAC inhibitor within MuSCs, leading to acetylation and activation of an HDAC1 target protein p53. Finally, we demonstrate that p53 activation contributes to the deep quiescence and enhanced resilience observed during fasting."

Increased BHB has been reported to prevent or improve age-related disease. The present studies were performed to understand the therapeutic effect and potential mechanisms of exogenous BHB in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelinating model. In this study, a continuous 35 days CPZ mouse model with or without BHB was established. The changes of behavior function, pathological hallmarks of CPZ, and intracellular signal pathways in mice were detected by Open feld test, Morris water maze, RT-PCR, immuno-histochemistry, and western blot. The results showed that BHB treatment improved behavioral performance, prevented myelin loss, decreased the activation of astrocyte as well as microglia, and up-regulated the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor in both the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Meanwhile, BHB treatment increased the number of MCT1(+) cells and APC(+) oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the expression of HDAC3, PARP1, AIF and TRPA1 which is related to oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis in the corpus callosum, accompanied by increased expression of TrkB. This leads to an increased density of doublecortin (DCX)(+) neuronal precursor cells and mature NeuN(+) neuronal cells in the hippocampus. As a result, BHB treatment effectively promotes the generation of PDGF-Ra(+) (oligodendrocyte precursor cells, OPCs), Sox2(+) cells and GFAP(+) (astrocytes), and decreased the production of GFAP(+) TRAP1(+) cells, and Oligo2(+) TRAP1(+) cells in the corpus callosum of mouse brain. Thus, our results demonstrate that BHB treatment efficiently supports OPC differentiation and decreases the OLs apoptosis in CPZ-intoxicated mice, partly by down-regulating the expression of TRPA1 and PARP, which is associated with the inhibition of the p38-MAPK/JNK/JUN pathway and the activation of ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, supporting BHB treatment adjunctive nutritional therapy for the treatment of chronic demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)."

Prior work has shown that microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) isolated from animals with experimental PAH and patients with PAH exhibit significant abnormalities in metabolism and calcium signaling. With regards to metabolism, we and others have shown evidence of increased aerobic glycolysis and evidence of increased utilization of alternate fuel sources (such as fatty acids) in PAH EC. In the realm of calcium signaling, our prior work linked increased activity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) channel to increased proliferation of MVECs isolated from the Sugen/Hypoxia rat model of PAH (SuHx-MVECs). However, the relationship between metabolic shifts and calcium abnormalities was not clear. Specifically, whether shifts in metabolism were responsible for increasing TRPV4 channel activity in SuHx-MVECs was not known. In this study, using human data, serum samples from SuHx rats, and SuHx-MVECs, we describe the consequences of increased MVEC fatty acid oxidation in PAH. In human samples, we observed an increase in long-chain fatty acid levels that was associated with PAH severity. Next, using SuHx rats and SuHx-MVECs, we observed increased intracellular levels of lipids. We also show that increasing intracellular lipid content increases TRPV4 activity, whereas inhibiting fatty acid oxidation normalizes basal calcium levels in SuHx-MVECs. By exploring the fate of fatty acid-derived carbons, we observed that the metabolite linking increased intracellular lipids to TRPV4 activity was beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), a product of fatty acid oxidation. Finally, we show that BOHB supplementation alone is sufficient to sensitize the TRPV4 channel in rat and mouse MVECs. Returning to humans, we observe a transpulmonary BOHB gradient in human patients with PAH. Thus, we establish a link between fatty acid oxidation, BOHB production, and TRPV4 activity in MVECs in PAH. These data provide new insight into metabolic regulation of calcium signaling in lung MVECs in PAH.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this paper, we explore the link between metabolism and intracellular calcium levels in microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We show that fatty acid oxidation promotes sensitivity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) calcium channel in MVECs isolated from a rodent model of PAH."

To determine the neuroregenerative potential of D,L-sodium-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D/L-BHB), Sprague Dawley rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to simulated central nervous system injury using a scratch assay. The neuronal cell migration, cell density and degree of regeneration in the damaged areas (gaps) in the absence (control) and presence of BHB (2 mM) were documented with automated live-cell imaging by the CytoSMART system over 24 h, which was followed by immunocytochemistry, labeling synapsin-I and beta3-tubulin. The cell density was significantly higher in the gaps with BHB treatment after 24 h compared to the control. In the control, only 1.5% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h, while in the BHB-treated samples 49.23% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h. In the control, the gap expanded by 63.81% post-injury, while the gap size decreased by 10.83% in response to BHB treatment, compared to the baseline. The cell density increased by 97.27% and the gap size was reduced by 74.64% in response to BHB, compared to the control. The distance travelled and velocity of migrating cells were significantly higher with BHB treatment, while more synapsin-I and beta3-tubulin were found in the BHB-treated samples after 24 h, compared to the control. The results demonstrate that D/L-BHB enhanced neuronal migration and molecular processes associated with neural regeneration and axonogenesis. These results may have clinical therapeutic applications in the future for nervous system injuries, such as for stroke, concussion and TBI patients."

The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for regulating the Trx1 level and/or activity during diabetic cardiomyopathy is unknown. beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a major ketone body in mammals, acts as an alternative energy source in cardiomyocytes under stress, but it also appears to be involved in additional mechanisms that protect the heart against stress. betaHB upregulated Trx1 in primary cultured cardiomyocytes in a dose- and a time-dependent manner and a ketogenic diet upregulated Trx1 in the heart. betaHB protected cardiomyocytes against H(2)O(2)-induced death, an effect that was abolished in the presence of Trx1 knockdown. betaHB also alleviated the H(2)O(2)-induced inhibition of mTOR and AMPK, known targets of Trx1, in a Trx1-dependent manner, suggesting that betaHB potentiates Trx1 function. It has been shown that betaHB is a natural inhibitor of HDAC1 and knockdown of HDAC1 upregulated Trx1 in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that betaHB may upregulate Trx1 through HDAC inhibition. betaHB induced Trx1 acetylation and inhibited Trx1 degradation, suggesting that betaHB-induced inhibition of HDAC1 may stabilize Trx1 through protein acetylation. These results suggest that betaHB potentiates the antioxidant defense in cardiomyocytes through the inhibition of HDAC1 and the increased acetylation and consequent stabilization of Trx1. Thus, modest upregulation of ketone bodies in diabetic hearts may protect the heart through the upregulation of Trx1.;Background Heart failure is responsible for approximately 65% of deaths in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, existing therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus have limited success on the prevention of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate elevation in D-beta-hydroxybutyrate improves cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results Type 2 diabetic (db/db) and their corresponding wild-type mice were fed a control diet or a diet where carbohydrates were equicalorically replaced by D-beta-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3 butanediol monoester (ketone ester [KE]). After 4 weeks, echocardiography demonstrated that a KE diet improved systolic and diastolic function in db/db mice. A KE diet increased expression of mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase and restored decreased expression of mitochondrial beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, key enzymes in cardiac ketone metabolism. A KE diet significantly enhanced both basal and ADP-mediated oxygen consumption in cardiac mitochondria from both wild-type and db/db animals, however, it did not result in the increased mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. Additionally, db/db mice on a KE diet had increased resistance to oxidative and redox stress, with evidence of restoration of decreased expression of thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidase 4 and less permeability transition pore activity in mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy were significantly increased in cardiomyocytes from db/db mice on a KE diet. The increase in mitophagy was correlated with restoration of mitofusin 2 expression, which contributed to improved coupling between cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase translocation into mitochondria and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-mediated autophagosome formation. Conclusions Moderate elevation in circulating D-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels via KE supplementation enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, quality control, and oxygen consumption and increases resistance to oxidative/redox stress and mPTP opening, thus resulting in improvement of cardiac function in animals with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

A maladaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis aggravate the disease. Melatonin (MEL) and hydroxybutyrate (BHB) have both shown promise in terms of decreasing Abeta pathology. The goal of this study was to see how BHB and MEL affected the UPR, autophagy, and pyroptosis pathways in Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with BHB, MEL, or a combination of the two after being exposed to A beta1-42 and LPS. Cell viability was determined using the MTT test, and gene expression levels of UPR (ATF6, PERK, and CHOP), autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3II, P62, and Atg5), and pyroptosis-related markers (NLRP3, TXNIP, IL-1beta, and NFkappaB1) were determined using quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. RESULTS: BHB and MEL significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in the presence of A beta1-42 and LPS. Both compounds inhibited the expression of maladaptive UPR and autophagy-related genes, as well as inflammatory and pyroptotic markers caused by Abeta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: BHB and MEL rescue neurons in A beta1-42 and LPS-induced SH-SY5Y cells by reducing maladaptive UPR, excessive autophagy, and pyroptosis.

The ketogenic diet significantly affects cell energy metabolism and functioning of mitochondria, which has been actively studied in various age-related pathologies. Here, we investigated the effect of the ketogenic diet mimetic beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on the expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Ppargc1a, Nrf1, Tfam), quality control (Sqstm1), functioning of the antioxidant system (Nfe2l2, Gpx1, Gpx3, Srxn1, Txnrd2, Slc6a9, Slc7a11), and inflammatory response (Il1b, Tnf, Ptgs2, Gfap) in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles of young and old rats. We also analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, accumulation of mtDNA damage, and levels of oxidative stress based on the concentration of reduced glutathione and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). In some organs, aging disrupted mitochondrial biogenesis and functioning of cell antioxidant system, which was accompanied by the increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Administration of BHB for 2 weeks had different effects on the organs of young and old rats. In particular, BHB upregulated expression of genes coding for proteins associated with the mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system, especially in the liver and muscles of young (but not old) rats. At the same time, BHB contributed to the reduction of TBARS in the kidneys of old rats. Therefore, our study has shown that administration of ketone bodies significantly affected gene expression in organs, especially in young rats, by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the functioning of the antioxidant defense system, and partially reducing the level of oxidative stress. However, these changes were much less pronounced in old animals."

Diets contained equal amounts of fat, protein, and micronutrients. The KE group was fed ad libitum, whereas the control (Ctrl) mice were pair-fed to the KE group. Blood d-beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in the KE group were 3-5 times those reported with high-fat ketogenic diets. Voluntary food intake was reduced dose dependently with the KE diet. Feeding the KE diet for up to 1 mo increased the number of mitochondria and doubled the electron transport chain proteins, uncoupling protein 1, and mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating proteins in the interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). [(18)F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in IBAT of the KE group was twice that in IBAT of the Ctrl group. Plasma leptin levels of the KE group were more than 2-fold those of the Ctrl group and were associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity to IBAT. The KE group exhibited 14% greater resting energy expenditure, but the total energy expenditure measured over a 24-h period or body weights was not different. The quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index was 73% higher in the KE group. These results identify KE as a potential antiobesity supplement.;The presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in human adults opens attractive perspectives to treat metabolic disorders. Indeed, BAT dissipates energy as heat via uncoupling protein (UCP)1. Brown adipocytes are located in specific deposits or can emerge among white fat through the so-called browning process. Although numerous inducers have been shown to drive this process, no study has investigated whether it could be controlled by specific metabolites. Here, we show that lactate, an important metabolic intermediate, induces browning of murine white adipose cells with expression of functional UCP1. Lactate-induced browning also occurs in human cells and in vivo. Lactate controls Ucp1 expression independently of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and PPARalpha pathways but requires active PPARgamma signaling. We demonstrate that the lactate effect on Ucp1 is mediated by intracellular redox modifications as a result of lactate transport through monocarboxylate transporters. Further, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, another metabolite that impacts redox state, is also a strong browning inducer. Because this redox-dependent increase in Ucp1 expression promotes an oxidative phenotype with mitochondria, browning appears as an adaptive mechanism to alleviate redox pressure. Our findings open new perspectives for the control of adipose tissue browning and its physiological relevance.;AIMS: Previous work has demonstrated that ketogenic diets promote white fat browning, however, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenom have yet to be elucidated. Recently, an in vitro study showed that supraphysiological concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB) had a strong influence on the induction of adipocyte browning. On the other hand, concentrations in the physiological range, achieved through ketogenic diets and prolonged fasting produce values of 1-3 mM and 4-7 mM, respectively. Herein, we investigated the impact of physiological concentrations of betaHB on metabolism, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and other browning markers in adipose tissues. MAIN METHODS: The effects of betaHB on adipocyte browning were investigated in vitro, using primary cultures of isolated visceral and subcutaneous fat cells and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in vivo. KEY FINDINGS: It was determined that betaHB failed to induce changes in the oxidative capacity, citrate synthase activity or browning gene expression patterns in isolated adipocytes, and did not exert a permissive effect on beta-adrenergic agonist-induced browning. In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated following betaHB treatment exhibited downregulated Ucp1 expression levels, a result that was recapitulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Wistar rats after betaHB salt treatment. Rats administered betaHB salts also presented reduced brown adipose tissue UCP1 protein expression. SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanisms underlying ketogenic diet-induced browning of adipocytes are not known. The results from the present study indicate that physiological concentrations of betaHB are not responsible for this phenomenon, despite the observed betaHB-mediated downregulation of UCP1 expression.;White adipose tissue (WAT) has the capacity to undergo a white-to-beige phenotypic switch, known as browning, in response to stimuli such as cold. However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is highly induced in WAT and has been implicated in lipid metabolism. Here, we show that ApoE deficiency in mice increased oxygen consumption and thermogenesis and enhanced adipose browning pattern in inguinal WAT (iWAT), with associated characteristics such as increased Ucp1 and Ppargamma expression. At the cellular level, ApoE deficient beige adipocytes had increased glucose uptake and higher mitochondrial respiration than wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we showed that ApoE deficient iWAT and primary adipose precursor cells activated the thermogenic genes program by stimulating the production of ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaHB), a novel adipose browning promoting factor. This was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in ketogenesis and could be compromised by the treatment for ketogenesis inhibitors. Consistently, ApoE deficient mice show higher serum betaHB level than wild-type mice in the fed state and during cold exposure. Our results further demonstrate that the increased betaHB production in ApoE deficient adipose precursor cells could be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced Cd36 expression and CD36-mediated fatty acid utilization. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized role for ApoE in energy homeostasis via its cell-autonomous action in WAT.;PURPOSE: Fat browning contributes to energy consumption and may have metabolic benefits against obesity, however, the potential roles of lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) in fat browning remain unclear. We investigated the roles of a single bout of aerobic exercise that increases lactate and beta-HB levels in the fasted state on the regulation of fat browning in rats and humans. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 24-h fasting and/or a single bout moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (40 min): sedentary (CON), exercise (ND-EX), fasting (FAST), and exercise + fasting (F-EX). Adult men ( n = 13) were randomly assigned into control with food intake (CON), exercise with intensity at onset of blood lactate accumulation in the fasted state (F-OBLA), and high-intensity interval exercise in the fasted state (F-HIIE) until each participant expended 350 kcal of energy. For evaluating the effects of exercise intensity in rats, we conducted another set of animal experiment, including groups of sedentary fed control, fasting control, and exercise with moderate-intensity or HIIE for 40 min after a 24-h fasting. RESULTS: Regardless of fasting, single bout of exercise increases the concentration of lactate and beta-HB in rats, but the exercise in the fasted state increases the beta-HB level more significantly in rats and humans. F-EX-activated fat browning (AMPK-SirT1-PGC1alpha pathway and PRDM16) and thermogenic factor (UCP1) in white fat of rats. In rats and humans, exercise in the fasted state increased the blood levels of fat browning-related adipomyokines. In particular, compared with F-OBLA, F-HIIE more efficiently increases free fatty acid as well as blood levels of fat browning adipomyokines in humans, which was correlated with blood levels of lactate and beta-HB. In rats that performed exercise with different intensity, the higher plasma lactate and beta-HB levels, and higher expression of p-AMPK, UCP1, and PRDM16 in white adipose tissue of HIIE group than those of moderate-intensity group, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A single bout of aerobic exercise in the fasted state significantly induced fat browning-related pathways, free fatty acid, and adipomyokines, particularly F-HIIE in human. Although further evidence for supporting our results is required in humans, aerobic exercise in the fasted state with high intensity that increase lactate and beta-HB may be a modality of fat browning.;AIM: To investigate the effects of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and melatonin on brown adipose tissue (BAT) plasticity in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS: We employed a 7-week experimental design for a study on 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into five groups: (1) a control-diet fed group, (2) a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed group, (3) a group that received an HFD and a BHB solution in their drinking water, (4) a group that received an HFD with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin in their drinking water, and (5) a group that received an HFD and were also treated with the combination of BHB and melatonin. Following the treatment period, biochemical indices, gene expression levels of key thermogenic markers (including uncoupling protein 1 [UCP1], PR domain containing 16 [PRDM16], Cidea, fat-specific protein 27 [Fsp27], and metallothionein 1 [MT1]), and stereological assessments of BAT were evaluated. RESULTS: Treatment with BHB and melatonin significantly boosted blood ketone levels, improved lipid profiles, and reduced weight gain from an HFD. It also downregulated genes linked to WAT, namely, Cidea and Fsp27, and upregulated key BAT markers, including UCP1, PRDM16 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha. Additionally, the co-treatment increased MT1 receptor expression and enhanced the structural density of BAT. CONCLUSION: The combined oral administration of BHB and melatonin successfully prevented the whitening of BAT in obese rats fed an HFD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related BAT dysfunction. The synergistic effects of this treatment underscore the potential of a combined approach to address BAT dysfunction in obesity.;INTRODUCTION: Despite evidence suggesting that metabolic intermediates like beta-HB influence white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolism, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) on the fat browning program and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models. We assessed the effects of beta-HB on fat browning in adipocytes using 3T3-L1 cells and rat models. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of beta-HB on fat browning, thermogenesis, lipid accumulation, adipokine expression, and mitochondrial biogenesis by treating mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes with sodium beta-HB for 24 h or by continuously exposing preadipocytes to beta-HB during the 8-day differentiation process. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, exercise only (EX), ketogenic diet only (KD), and combined exercise and ketogenic diet (KE) groups for an 8-week intervention involving diet and/or exercise. After intervention, we evaluated WAT histology, plasma lipids and adipokines, and the expression of markers related to fat browning, thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT of rats. RESULTS: In our adipocyte culture experiments, beta-HB reduced intracellular lipid accumulation by enhancing lipolysis and stimulated the expression of thermogenic and fat browning genes like uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and adipokines such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FDNC5). Additionally, beta-HB activated the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway, with UCP1 and PRDM16 upregulation mediated by beta-HB intracellular action and SIRT1 activity. In animal experiments, KE group raised beta-HB levels, decreasing body weight and blood lipids. KD with EX promoted WAT browning possibly via AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha, augmenting PRDM16, UCP1, FGF21, and FNDC5 expression. CONCLUSION: beta-HB induction via KD and/or EX shows potential in promoting WAT browning by activating mitochondrial biogenesis, lipolysis, and thermogenesis, suggesting that dietary and physical intervention inducing beta-HB may benefit metabolic health.;Some studies indicate that brown adipose tissue (BAT) represents a promising target in the fight against dysmetabolic diseases, with indications suggesting it as a potential target for the effects of ketone bodies. We investigate whether the elevation of plasma levels of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, achieved through the in vivo administration of its precursor 1,3-butanediol (BD) to rats, could impact interscapular BAT (iBAT) mitochondrial biochemistry and functionality. We examined the effects induced by BD within 3 h and after 2 weeks of treatment. A large-scale quantitative proteomics approach, coupling liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, and Western blot associated with functional studies by respirometry allowed us to evaluate the changes in iBAT mitochondrial protein expression and bioenergetics induced by BD. BD administration increased beta-hydroxybutyrate plasma levels, which correlated with an enhancement in iBAT mitochondrial respiration rate, likely due to the activation of the respiratory chain and uncoupling protein-1. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that BD influenced the mitochondrial levels of specific subunits belonging to the five respiratory complexes, uncoupling protein-1, and proteins involved in propanoate metabolism. BD administration also induced lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation of mitochondrial proteins, including specific subunits of the respiratory chain complexes and uncoupling protein-1. Most of the BD-induced effects were observed within 3 h of its administration and persisted/increased after 2 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, by using BD to increase beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, we provide evidence supporting the role of beta-hydroxybutyrate as a signaling molecule capable of rapidly modulating BAT physiology by acting at the mitochondrial level."

We used mice inducibly expressing a mutated form of the mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme UNG1 (mutUNG1) to cause progressive mitochondrial dysfunction selectively in forebrain neurons. We examined the levels of mRNAs and proteins crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. We show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons in mutUNG1 mice, as well as cultured rat hippocampal neurons and human fibroblasts with H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress, improve markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and function when fed on a KD, and when exposed to the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively, by upregulating PGC1alpha, SIRT3 and UCP2, and (in cultured cells) increasing the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The mitochondrial level of UCP2 was significantly higher in the perikarya and axon terminals of hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in KD treated mutUNG1 mice compared with mutUNG1 mice fed a standard diet. The beta-hydroxybutyrate receptor GPR109a (HCAR2), but not the structurally closely related lactate receptor GPR81 (HCAR1), was upregulated in mutUNG1 mice on a KD, suggesting a selective influence of KD on ketone body receptor mechanisms. We conclude that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction in mutUNG1 expressing mice causes oxidative stress, and that exposure of animals to KD, or of cells to ketone body in vitro, elicits compensatory mechanisms acting to augment mitochondrial mass and bioenergetics via the PGC1alpha-SIRT3-UCP2 axis (The compensatory processes are overwhelmed in the mutUNG1 mice by all the newly formed mitochondria being dysfunctional).;Ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (betaOHB) and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) have been proposed to mediate systemic metabolic response to fasting. However, it remains elusive about the signaling elicited by ketone and FGF21 in the heart. Stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with betaOHB and FGF21 induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PGC1alpha expression along with the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. betaOHB and FGF21 induced transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPRE)-containing genes through an activation of PPARalpha. Additionally, betaOHB and FGF21 induced the expression of Nrf2, a master regulator for oxidative stress response, and catalase and Ucp2 genes. We evaluated the oxidative stress response gene expression after 24 h fast in global Fgf21-null (Fgf21(-/-)) mice, cardiomyocyte-specific FGF21-null (cmFgf21(-/-)) mice, wild-type (WT), and Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Fgf21(-/-) mice but not cmFgf21(-/-) mice had unexpectedly higher serum betaOHB levels, and higher expression levels of PPARalpha and oxidative stress response genes than WT mice or Fgf21(fl/fl) littermates. Notably, expression levels of oxidative stress response genes were significantly correlated with serum betaOHB and PGC1alpha levels in both WT and Fgf21(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that fasting-induced betaOHB and circulating FGF21 coordinately regulate oxidative stress response gene expression in the heart."
ENSG00000177169,ULK1,0.62224644,weak,1,33173467,2020,Brain/CNS,Effect of beta-Hydroxybutyrate on Autophagy Dynamics During Severe Hypoglycemia and the Hypoglycemic Coma.,"Glucose supply from blood is mandatory for brain functioning and its interruption during acute hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia leads to brain injury. Alternative substrates to glucose such as the ketone bodies (KB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can be used as energy fuels in the brain during hypoglycemia and prevent neuronal death, but the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. During glucose deprivation adaptive cell responses can be activated such as autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent degradation process, to support cell survival. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can lead to cell dysfunction. We have previously shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation in cortical neurons and that D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) reestablishes the autophagic flux increasing viability. Here, we aimed to investigate autophagy dynamics in the brain of rats subjected to severe hypoglycemia (SH) without glucose infusion (GI), severe hypoglycemia followed by GI (SH + GI), and a brief period of hypoglycemic coma followed by GI (Coma). The effect of D-BHB administration after the coma was also tested (Coma + BHB). The transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II and the abundance of autophagy proteins, Beclin 1 (BECN1), ATG7, and ATG12-ATG5 conjugate, were analyzed as an index of autophagosome formation, and the levels of sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) were determined as a hallmark of autophagic degradation. Data suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats after SH, likely due to impaired autophagic degradation. In the cortex, autophagosome accumulation persisted at 6 h after GI in animals exposed to SH but recovered basal levels at 24 h, while in the hippocampus no significant effect was observed. In animals subjected to coma, autophagosome accumulation was observed at 24 h after GI in both regions. D-BHB treatment reduced LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 content and reduced ULK1 phosphorylation by AMPK, suggesting it stimulates the autophagic flux and decreases AMPK activity reducing autophagy initiation. D-BHB also reduced the number of degenerating cells. Together, data suggest different autophagy dynamics after GI in rats subjected to SH or the hypoglycemic coma and support that D-BHB treatment can modulate autophagy dynamics favoring the autophagic flux."

One of the metabolic consequences of this insulin deficit is an increased hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies, resulting in a serious medical complication, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA, in turn, has been associated with the development of cerebral edema. The severity of this complication ranges from death to a subclinical presentation, but seems to be invariably present to some degree. The etiology of the cerebral edema is unknown, but changes in osmolality, pH, and insulin effects on the blood-brain barrier have all been suggested as possible culprits. Blood-brain barrier impermeability is maintained by the endothelial cells (EC) lining the blood vessels. Thus, it would seem likely that alterations in EC function would be necessary for the development of cerebral edema. However, no studies have examined the effects of ketone bodies on brain endothelial cells. The two major ketone bodies in DKA are acetoacetate (AcAc) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB). In the present study we examined the effect of these ketone bodies on a major intracellular signalling pathway. The changes in intracellular calcium concentration, and the production of two vasoactive peptides, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vascular permeability factor (VPF/VEGF) in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC). The present studies demonstrate the BOHB can increase vascular permeability factor. In contrast, AcAc increases the production of the potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. This data would suggest that brain ECs are potential targets of the metabolic alterations in DKA.;Endothelial injury is regarded as the initial pathological process in diabetic vascular diseases, but effective therapy has not yet been identified. Although beta-hydroxybutyrate plays various protective roles in the cardiovascular system, its ability to antagonize diabetic endothelial injury is unclear. beta-hydroxybutyrate reportedly causes histone H3K9 beta-hydroxybutyrylation (H3K9bhb), which activates gene expression, however, there has been no report regarding the role of H3K9bhb in up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a crucial factor in endothelial integrity and function. Here, male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes, and then treated with different concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate. After 10 weeks, body weight, blood glucose, morphological changes and serum nitric oxide concentration were examined. Moreover, the mRNA expression level, protein content and distribution of VEGF in the aorta were investigated, as were total protein beta-hydroxybutyrylation and H3K9bhb contents. The results showed injury of aortic endothelium, along with reductions of the concentration of nitric oxide and generation of VEGF in diabetic rats. However, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment attenuated diabetic injury of the endothelium and up-regulated the generation of VEGF. Furthermore, beta-hydroxybutyrate treatment caused marked total protein beta-hydroxybutyrylation and significant elevation of H3K9bhb content in the aorta of diabetic rats. The ability of beta-hydroxybutyrate to protect against diabetic injury of the aortic endothelium was greatest for its intermediate concentration. In conclusion, moderately elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate could antagonize aortic endothelial injury, potentially by causing H3K9bhb to promote generation of VEGF in diabetic rats.;BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains one of the major causes of death worldwide, and innovative treatment strategies for MI represent a major challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Caloric restriction (CR) is the most potent nonpharmacological intervention known to prevent age-related disorders and extend lifespan. CR reduces glycolysis and elevates ketone body metabolism. However, whether and how CR or ketone body prevents the progression of MI remains poorly defined. METHODS: Mice treated with CR and beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) underwent MI induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiographic measurements. Histological analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and immunofluorescence were used to assess myocardial neovascularization and macrophage filtration. The interaction and modification of beta-OHB on PHD2 were analyzed by molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, and coimmunoprecipitation. Macrophage-specific PHD2 K239R and K385R knock-in mice were used to determine the functional significance of beta-OHB/PHD2 axis in vivo. RESULTS: Twelve weeks of CR markedly rescued postinfarction cardiac function by enhancing neovascularization. CR significantly increased circulating and cardiac ketone bodies, including beta-OHB and acetoacetate. We identified beta-OHB but not acetoacetate selectively targeted macrophages to stimulate VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production in the peri-infarct area to promote neovascularization and cardiac repair. Mechanistically, beta-OHB binds to and induces lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation of PHD2 at lysines 239 and 385, thus blocking its function in the hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha) and resulting in enhanced HIF1alpha-dependent VEGF transcription and secretion. More importantly, specific PHD2 lys239 and lys385 mutations in macrophages abolished the preventive effects of exogenous beta-OHB on MI in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal a novel regulation of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation on PHD2 and demonstrate a promising and therapeutic role for beta-OHB/PHD2 in effectively accelerating neovascularization and preserving heart function after cardiac ischemia."
ENSG00000150630,VEGFC,0.3558079,weak,1,36730763,2023,Vasculature,A High-Fat Diet in the Absence of Obesity Increases Lymphangiogenesis by Inducing VEGF-C in a Murine Lymphedema Model.,"BACKGROUND: Many researchers have attempted to induce lymphangiogenesis for the treatment of lymphedema. However, most previous studies had limited clinical usefulness. A high-fat diet (HFD) increases serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) levels, which can stimulate lymphangiogenesis. The authors hypothesized that an HFD will ameliorate lymphedema through enhanced lymphangiogenesis. METHODS: The effects of beta-OHB on the lymphangiogenic process in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells were analyzed. A mouse tail lymphedema model was used to evaluate the effects of an HFD on lymphedema. Experimental mice were fed an HFD (45% kcal as fat, 20% as protein, and 35% as carbohydrates) for 4 weeks. Tail volume was measured using the truncated cone formula. Biopsy specimens were taken 6 weeks after surgical induction of lymphedema. RESULTS: In human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells, treatment with 20 mM of beta-OHB increased cell viability ( P = 0.008), cell migration ( P = 0.011), tube formation ( P = 0.005), and VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression ( P < 0.001) compared with controls. HFD feeding decreased tail volume by 14.3% and fibrosis by 15.8% ( P = 0.027), and increased the lymphatic vessel density ( P = 0.022) and VEGF-C protein expression ( P = 0.005) compared with those of operated, standard chow diet-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings demonstrated that beta-OHB promoted lymphatic endothelial cell function and increased VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression. When mice with tail lymphedema were fed an HFD, volume and fibrosis of the tail decreased. Therefore, the authors' findings suggest that an HFD can be a successful novel dietary approach to treating lymphedema. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Lymphatic regeneration after vascularized lymph node transfer can be augmented when a high-fat diet is used in conjunction with vascularized lymph node transfer."
ENSG00000026025,VIM,0.33094877,weak,1,20959534,2011,Kidney,Proteomics analysis reveals diabetic kidney as a ketogenic organ in type 2 diabetes.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM beta-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-beta1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. beta-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN."

However, in chronic obesity, they can exhibit an activated pro-fibrotic, extracellular matrix (ECM)-depositing phenotype that highly aggravates obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. METHODS: Given that progenitors' fibrotic activation and fat cell browning appear to be antagonistic cell fates, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of pro-browning agents in an obesogenic condition. RESULTS: In obese mice fed a high fat diet, thermoneutral housing, which induces brown fat cell dormancy, increases the expression of ECM gene programs compared to conventionally raised animals, indicating aggravation of obesity-related tissue fibrosis at thermoneutrality. In a model of primary cultured murine adipose progenitors, we found that exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate selectively reduced Tgfbeta-dependent profibrotic responses of ECM genes like Ctgf, Loxl2 and Fn1. This effect is observed in both subcutaneous and visceral-derived adipose progenitors, as well as in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In 30 patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery, those with higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels have lower subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrotic scores. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate limits Tgfbeta-dependent collagen accumulation and reduces Smad2-3 protein expression and phosphorylation in visceral progenitors. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate induces the expression of the ZFP36 gene, encoding a post-transcriptional regulator that promotes the degradation of mRNA by binding to AU-rich sites within 3'UTRs. Importantly, complete ZFP36 deficiency in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line from null mice, or siRNA knock-down in primary progenitors, indicate that ZFP36 is required for beta-hydroxybutyrate anti-fibrotic effects. CONCLUSION: These data unravel the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate to limit adipose tissue matrix deposition, a finding that might exploited in an obesogenic context.;beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is one of main component of ketone body, which plays an important protective role in various tissues and organs. Whereas, its exact regulatory roles and mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) have not been full elucidated. In this study, SN4741 cells and C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))/1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish the PD model in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability and damage to dopaminergic neurons were measured by cell counting kit 8, Calcein-AM/PI staining, terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and hematoxylin & eosin staining. Corresponding assay kits and BODIPY 581/591 C11 probe evaluated oxidative stress and intracellular iron levels. Western blot examined the ferroptosis-related proteins. MPTP/MPP(+)-treatment reduced cell viability but triggered oxidative stress and ferroptosis in SNA4741 cells and brain tissues of mice. However, these effects were dramatically reversed by BHB and Fer-1 treatment. Mechanistically, Zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) was a target of BHB, and its depletion could reverse the anti-oxidative stress and anti-ferroptosis roles of BHB. Moreover, ZFP36 could directly bound to acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) mRNA to decay its expression, thus negatively modulating ACSL4-mediated oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Summary, BHB alleviated oxidative stress and ferroptosis of dopaminergic neurons in PD via modulating ZFP36/ACSL4 axis, which provided some new understanding for PD prevention and treatment."
